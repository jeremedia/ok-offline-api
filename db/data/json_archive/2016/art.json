Year after year, after returning home to Alabama from this Burning Man. I would feel so inspired but unable to take the next step in becoming part of it by creating art of my own. \r\n\r\nThis project is much bigger than just an oversized guitar; this is the beginning of an ongoing effort to generate creativity in my hometown and all over the South. I want to show people that creative thinking and actually creating is easier than one may expect, and eventually get into a position to help them reach their goals; just as you are here to help me with mine. I want to inspire others not only to think creatively, but to get out and do something about it. Help me show others that THEY CAN!",

For the meager price of a kind thought, the machine dispenses a personal illumination device in an iconic plastic egg. A tombstone receptacle sits on the side to collect the empty eggs. \r\n\r\nThis piece is an oasis of light in the darkness. From it, individuals carry sparks of light out to the rest of the playa. Metaphorically this depicts the ongoing evolution of human society through individual acts of kindness. Be the light you wish to see in the world, and help others shine too!",

    "description": "\"Ken Deemer (who has a dog named Joey and a son named Kevin), Kevin loves you and says hi!\"\r\n\r\nLast year on Burn night we received this note (from a stranger) to pass along (to a stranger) but were unable to identify a Ken Deemer who looked like his dog would be named Joey on that particular evening. This ~6 ft wind sock, made of rip-stop nylon, will be hand-dyed and painted with this message, and mounted securely on a pole on the open playa. With a little playa magic, maybe Ken will see it. If not, we will have tried our best to deliver the words of love entrusted to us.\r\n\r\nThis project interacts directly with one particular Burner, Ken Deemer. However, we hope that many people will consider the Ken Deemers in their own lives when they view this piece.",

The piece \"Shoot the Moon\" has three meanings, one Canis lupus and his family were avid archers.  Secondly, Canis lupus, his family and friends would play Pinochle together, \"shooting the moon\" as it applies to pinochle is a play that can win the whole game in one hand.  Thirdly, Canis lupus means wolf - the wolf at the bottom of the bow, will be howling at the moon.  \r\n\r\nThe piece is a 10' x 6' x 4'.  The bow is on a rotating base with a wolf howling at the moon under the bow.  The piece is made from scrap metal from various family ranches.  The tip of the arrow, the feathers, and the wolf's eye are made of copper by a fellow burner.",

The vessels are carefully engineered glass decanters and with a simple touch they emit the requisite measure of scent. The decanters are modest sculptures, their glass essentially transparent. The scents are in liquid form inside the vessels. They are as clear as the glass, and thus bring into question the concept, the purpose, of hue; released as vapor, they all are almost invisible. And finally, aligned in a particular sequence, the decanters tell the story that the smell artist desires to tell.",

The time portal will have an interactive clue aspect that you have to figure out in order to get the past to open up to you.\r\nThe front of the booth is heavy canvas walls painted to look like an ancient building with LED lit columns standing in front. The side project, the Da Vinci Code Capade, will involve picking up a cypher card in front of the booth and figuring out clues to take you around the playa.

First you'll take a tour of our workshop which is embellished with drapery and a parody of Leonardo-inspired paintings (including a 20-foot mural of The Last Supper as if they were all building drums). As RECRUITS, you'll learn our history and bring an offering to our founder. As an APPRENTICE, you'll discover your Rhythmic Identity Code and we'll send you on a Rhythm Quest! Once a JOURNEYMAN, we'll teach you a few of our drum-building secrets while you help us assemble drums to gift off-playa. If you make it that far, you'll complete your apprenticeship by building a drum of your OWN to prove yourself worthy of the title \"MASTER\" within our ranks! Throughout the week, you'll find facilitated drum circles & various workshops in our play space, and there will be plenty of time for all burners to explore their own sense of play!

    "description": "Awakening is a large scale interactive steel sculpture of a human head and two hands emerging from the ground.  The head and hands are 20ft tall and the hands are placed an \"arms\" length away from the head with palms facing inward, as if the giant being is looking at its hands for the first time.\r\nThe interior of the head is a darkened room that participants can enter and serves as a theater for viewing the outside world through the eyes of the head, as well as a control room for movement of the hands.  Using optical lenses in the eyes, the head is a stereoscopic camera obscura that focuses light from the outside and projects an image onto the back surface of the room. Participants are given 3D glasses to give the image depth with the perspective of a giant being.  The field of vision of the projected image is nearly 180 degrees vertically and horizontally, which gives the viewer a sense of immersion.  Each eye has a high-intensity spotlight to illuminate objects in its view at night.",

    "description": "The Ascension Pendulum is a blend of architecture and technology that serves to identify the unique touch human interaction represents while illustrating the beauty of the participant's experience. The 34' tall tetrahedron will support a large pendulum capable of drawing intricate patterns into the playa. By capturing the movement of the pendulum, three projectors draw an identical image in light on every side of the structure. This project's goal is not only to put the participant on display, but to involve them in creating a continually changing art piece. The amazing thing about the human element is that it is inherently random and by harnessing this, our project ensures that the same pattern can never be created twice unless by a robot in controlled circumstances. What this means is that each participant will be involved in not only creation, but synthesis, creating something completely new that cannot be replicated which represents each persons individuality in a aesthetically pleasing way.",

    "description": "\"Parasolvent\" is an interactive kinetic sculpture.  A 23 foot tall rotating ring of parasols that open as they ascend and close as they fall.  \r\nParasols are  protective devices created to shield us from the elements.  Here they represent the emotionally protective devices we believe are protecting us, but are in fact hindering our progression.  This is a meditative piece about letting them go.  The parasols exit a human figure, blossom (open) as they rise, and decay (close) as they fall.  Parasolvent was inspired by the artist's first Burning Man in 2013 and chosen as an Honorarium piece for 2014.",

The entire structure, covered with thousands of small irregularly-cut mirrors, shines from a distance. Unable to avoid shiny objects, myriads of Black Rock citizens will be drawn closer only to find their own reflections scattered, reorganized and blended with the reflection of others nearby. This installation endeavors to raise important questions in the group mind about the nature of Identity. Passing through the center of the portal reveals one's reflection now compressed by the inner concave nature of these mirrored walls. Two lighted buttons inside the portal activate a random set of verbal instructions for successful identity reorganization.\r\nIdentity Reorganization Portal is designed to be a gauntlet thrown down before the apparent solidity of the assumed \"I\".",

The hourglass is filling upwards with small particulates that float unhurriedly from bottom to top chamber; its translucent pellets catch the sunlight during the day and swirl like fireflies when LED lit at night. Like a meter that measures the growing creativity and energy around it, this hourglass fills steadily over the length of the event and stands full at exodus; full like an hourglass that has just been turned over, full like time itself has been turned back. Chronosydra is an art piece that mirrors the week-long transformation of Black Rock City, and playfully reflects on the way in which our time at Burning Man may reset, revivify, and refill us if we let it.",

Thus it becomes a more powerful & versatile object. The old & the new meld together: mechanical linkages & controls work in concert with computationally intense algorithms creating a delightful musical instrument for everyone.\r\nThis goes beyond the limitations of expectation for the original; music boxes usually play one short tune.  Here is shown that things do not always behave according to one's expectations. \r\nThe viewer is the catalyst necessary to fulfill its potential, becoming an integral component of the creative process. They become the artist, only one that is making a unique, ephemeral creation, the music, by means of their input & operation, all played out on the canvas of our device for the delight & appreciation of  all around them.",

But if we can remain open to the lessons offered by these losses, a deeper Self can be revealed.\r\n\r\n\u015ai\u1e63ya (pronounced shi-shya) refers to the relationship between a Guru (teacher) and a \u015bi\u1e63ya (disciple). In sanskrit, Gu means darkness and ru means the one who dispels them. Therefore, a guru is one who dispels the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe \u015ai\u1e63ya, a walk-through experience, prompts participants to recognize the opportunities created by the loss of a close relationship. Participants are encouraged to write on the walls near the prompts to share their stories with others.

    "description": "Enunciation is a cocoon of playable light. The piece creates space for participants to interact with the sculpture and each other. It contains many layers of interaction: viewing from afar, entering, playing the light field, and finally, using the light field as an instrument. The structure is made of triangular boxes of metal. On the interior-facing side, each box is outfitted with a laser cut back lit panel. The lights take input from simple buttons mounted in the center of various panels. With input, the panel alters the lighting scheme. Each press spreads effects and color across the surrounding panels, allowing for interplay between participants. Enunciation is a meditation on learning how to articulate oneself. The sculpture's primary function is to create an instrument for shared interaction, which offers more articulation with increased input of people and their time. Enunciation offers a strange way to communicate, but with practice, much can be articulated without speaking.",

    "description": "After the Events of 2175, the perfect storm of industrial pollution, population explosion and the destruction of biodiversity raged. It was only a renewal of the vows between science and nature that saved us. The amount of horrendous  wastes we had piled up over a millenia- much of it toxic and flammable- was daunting.  The Fuocco Falene are a crux of biomech, artistry and divine intervention. Fire moths- drawn to the most noxious of wastes, able to consume the wastes and leave a benign byproduct. Their consumption of fuels is spectacular, so much so that Falena became sought after for their beauty. It has become fashionable to convert outdated civic fixtures, like fountains, to be attractions to the Fuocco Falena. Le Attrata is a prime example of such an installation, its jagged spires providing perches for the Falena, the curved benches housing seating for people, and the Falena chrysalises lighting the way throughout the night.",

Islamic mathematical art is married to the great Western landscape, serenaded with the voice of your heart and the whisper of the Playa.\r\nROSHANAI comprises two double-walled panels that create a 108-ft long tunnel of light and sound with a 3-ft corridor. The sides of the hallway rise from 8-ft tall at the ends to 12-ft tall at the apex in the middle. Simultaneously, the panels sink into the ground to form a shallow valley. Fractal arrangements of Islamic geometric patterns are cut into the outside panels, lit from within to illuminate the patterns and cast fantastic night shadows. The entrances will be 16-ft tall gates inspired by the Great Mosque of Isfahan in Iran, pointed arches filled with sacred geometry. The inside walls are smooth and lit in solid colors by daylight-visible LED spotlights embedded in the edges of the floor.",

This year, in name of \"Radical Self Expression\" we sent out five hundred vinyl toy elephants to kids all over the world and asked them to express themselves by decorating them.  We are then taking those elephants and displaying them at Burning Man under The Man as part of the Guild Workshops piazza.\r\nOur aim is to bring awareness of the importance of creativity in a child's life. Lack of funding has stopped art programs in many public schools across the country. We are figuratively and literally putting the crayon back in the child's hand. We are also bringing 10,000 elephants to the playa this year and letting burners express themselves by decorating the elephants, and gifting them to fellow burners. \r\nWe chose to create a vinyl elephant for the kids to decorate because of the elephant's outstanding memory. We are building positive experiences in children that we want them to remember for a lifetime. \r\nWe also sculpted the elephant into the shape of the Vitruvian Man, as a wink to this year's Burning Man theme.",

Once inside the secret room, one will encounter a podium atop which sits a giant glowing community book for all to inscribe. Preconceptions will be challenged through play and exploration.\r\nJust like the Library of Alexandria, part way through the week, the Serapeum will burn to the ground, leaving ruins behind. The structure will now take on a second life, as people are able to experience the romance and magic of the folly. In the center of these ruins, the podium and Community Book will sit, appearing unscathed by the fire. Beauty and community will continue on, altered but unmoving.",

At the front of the space will be the start of what will be become a life size Da Vinci inspired steel wing. Participants will be able to forge steel feathers that will be added to the sculpture as the week progresses. This will result in a truly city wide built sculpture as people of all ages and backgrounds use their collective creativity to produce a metal work of art.",

Portraits, beauty, free speech, etc. coupled with guidance in assembling into vision when needed by the Guild artists! It's okay to handle, tool, and work and arrange\u2026 and see, and do! PLACEMENT in the moment, because YOU say so, and the magnetism used by the assemblage artist, interacts with the whole of this epicenter of Guild creativity. Art created can be taken, given away, picked up later, or labeled 'free' for anyone to take. Transposed and balanced with the public build, \"The Creative Cavern\" is a solo art experience booth where the artists can create in private - the artwork within will be unveiled at the end of the week!",

The form of the  structure is inspired by Donald Ingber's research on eukaryotic cell construction and biomechanics. A complex network of tensioned filaments connect the struts, with a nucleus suspended inside that is the mathematical DNA of the tensegrity. At night it comes alive as a structural data visualization and beacon.\r\nIntention explores the fundamental building blocks of our bodies by allowing the participant to immerse themselves within the responsive architecture of a nucleated tensegrity structure.",

    "description": "Tangential Dreams is a climbable sinuous tower made from off-the-shelf timber and digitally designed via algorithmic rules. One thousand \"tangent\" thin wooden pieces are held in position via horizontal pieces rotating along a central axis, gently moving in the wind like leaves of a giant tree. The pieces are stencilled with inspiring sentences, and dynamically lit by LED strips during the night time. In line with this year's theme, the piece is reminiscent of Leonardo's Vitruvian Man's movement and helicoid inventions as well as his deep, systematic, understanding of the rules behind form to create art. From a wooden flame all the way to a giant desert cactus, the complex simplicity of the art piece will trigger many interpretations, many dreams. The audience will read and discuss the poetry written on each tangent coming from the Burners' community itself via our crowd funding campaign like a collage of sentences creating a serendipitous \"cadavre exquis\" of thoughts.",

    "description": "Blue mirror-steel butterflies hover 17 ft over the desert, wings lifted as if just alighted, yet ready for takeoff. Stepping beneath the delicately-perforated, arching wingspan, vivid blue light scatters, encircling us in a vaulted, luminous space of geometric patterns/reflections. \"Imago\" holds a space, in structure and feeling, that is light and uplifting, like an intimate temple or futuristic shrine.\r\nThe elevated butterflies are easily-resonant metaphors for the transformative experiences that compel so many migrations to Burning Man: immersion into a place of imagination, to be renewed, transformed. \r\nButterfly metamorphosis mirrors our Playa experiences: intense preparations, followed by the suspension of mundane life, to immerse into a dreamlike space that is safe-yet-undefined, full of potential. When the time of cocooning is over, we emerge, high on imagination. Just as the mature butterfly, known as an imago, returns to the wider world, ripe for creation and pollination.",

The collection has passed through the centuries, taking different forms in different eras, and contains sounds previously thought lost to history.\r\nWhat did it sound like when the Mongols swept down from the steppe to invade Europe? Or the wildlife of the Galapagos Islands a hundred years before Darwin? An early morning walk through a fish market on the outskirts of Constantinople a thousand years before it became Istanbul? \r\n \r\nFortunately the Traveling Sound Museum will be making a stop in Black Rock City this year, as part of its never-ending journey through time. So burners who discover it on the playa will have an opportunity to find out.",

    "description": "TRASPARENZA, Temple of Transparency, celebrates emerging from darkness into light. It is an experiential installation that takes a chapel-like form, that Burners can enter and enjoy both inside and out. It is a playful and whimsical tribute to the genius of Leonardo da Vinci and the glories of the Italian Renaissance, a Florentine Folly. The structure is totally transparent, made of clear cast acrylic panels exquisitely laser-cut with intricate imagery. The words 'Saper Vedere', meaning 'knowing how to see', line the entrance. This was the phrase Leonardo used to describe the dominant skill of his own genius and the transparent installation plays with this notion.TRASPARENZA is a humanist chapel celebrating human endeavour and creativity, and the artist as inventor, where Burners form a colourful congregation visible to everyone outside. At its heart stands a completely see-through sculpture, \"Vitruvia\", that explores the concept of 'Divina Proportione' using the body of a woman rather than a man.",

Inspired by the artist's Abuela, Rosamelia, in Puerto Rico who turned 91 last year, the design is a Baroque style, gold, beveled frame with 91 roses for Rosamelia, identical on either side. The solid structure and ladders inspire awesome participation, encouraging passersby to BE THE ART. Step up, climb on, take a photograph...'monkey around', change the image, and invite others to join in. Have fun interacting with a large scale art piece and make a memory to take with you.",

Two carvers are on duty from about 1 pm till just after sunset.

    "description": "Ascension is a reflection of one person's journey of self-discovery pertaining to love. For many, the concept of being \"in love\" is defined by default society. Romantic plots in pop culture so often have characters falling in love uncontrollably to finally find \"happiness\". Society teaches us that the responsibility of our happiness lies on the shoulders of others. We spend so much time looking for happiness - love - everywhere but the one place we'll find it: within ourselves.\r\nAscension conveys a new definition of love: when separate, whole individuals form a partnership that reinforces their individuality while creating a unit where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Each person is growing as a whole individual first and foremost. The partnership reinforces this while bringing them both to a higher level, together. Through this symbolism, Ascension creates a space that inspires people to reflect on self love, loving others, and love as it relates to their world at large.",

    "description": "The Peace Pavilion is an octagonal wood shade structure conceived by Orca Moon a 12 year old artist and built by Disciples of the Dust.  There are 8 pillars and a prayer wheel on each post.  The prayer wheels have inspiring words of peace, love, kindness and blessings written in different languages.  \r\nPowerful artwork by Orca Moon is painted on the structure.  The mandalas and designs are of the colors  red, orange and gold.  Burners can interact by spinning the wheels as they walk around the structure, releasing powerful energy waves of kindness and compassion.  Lit inside and on the posts, lights shine up from each pillar at night symbolizing the feelings of good will and love being released to the Universe. Participants can gather under the shade.  \r\nIn the center of the pavilion is a Buddha created in both the feminine, masculine, animal and insect representing the God in all of us.  It is made of wood, metal and has mirrors around its body.",

Participants breathe life into the fire vortex by pedaling the bike-fan. Participants can shape the vortex, alter its rotation, width, height and intensity by varying their pedaling speed and adding bursts of propane via a handlebar mounted \"booster\" button.  RotoFuego will also serve as a gathering spot on cold playa nights -- a place for comfort and conversation, an opportunity to rest, warm up and make new friends.  The fire will be surrounded by benches for folks to sit upon and interact with one another and enjoy the flaming beauty their fellow participants create.",

    "description": "Art is a not a mirror held up to reality, but a hammer with which to shape it.\r\nBerthold Brecht\r\n This concept drives my creative process.\r\nThe goal of this piece is to raise the awareness of the human population to the devastation being wrought by our species on the oceans, which give life to our planet. \r\nThe piece will rotate on a central bearing when it is actuated by human interaction. A gentle push will cause the rotation  to simulate the movement of a school of sharks, swimming lazily in a rising spiral current. My goal is to underline the contrast of the beauty of schooling sharks in their ocean community, and the wasteful horror of shark finning by the human community.\r\nFrom a distance, the low profile of the turntable will show the school, to draw the playa community closer until the view is of the small cloud of sharks from below. Here will be placed the Ghost Shark on its back, as if lying finned and dead on the bottom in stark contrast to the live animals swimming above.",

As they play with the widgets, patterns of light appear on the cone, surrounding the participants with a dazzling color spectacle of their own creation and rewarding their curiosity.\r\n\r\nIllumicone is 19 feet tall at its center and 38 feet across at its base.  Cables descending from the top of the cone carry 3600 individually controlled LEDs. Inside the cone are interactive widgets constructed mostly out of repurposed objects. Manipulating the widgets causes patterns of light to appear and move across the LEDs. Spinning wooden wheels causes stripes to move around the cone and collide to create seemingly random combinations of color. Other widgets create sparkles, stain the cone with blotches that expand and disappear, or twist and turn the whole display.",

It is unclear as to the exact reason for this behavior, however, it is speculated that he did it to unleash his writer's block and tap into undiscovered portions of his brain. Leo speculated that using his non dominated hand and writing backwards would unleash new creative portions of his brain and therefore push creativity to the ultimate boundaries of the brain. I would like to create a block or canvas for the artist of Black Rock City to exercise and flex this backwards and non dominate creative muscle. The project is  a block like structure with a negative space block (see pictures). Paint pens hang from the ceiling for participants to write on the wooden, primed and painted structure with their non-dominate hand, backwards. From the doorway will hang a sign with a riddle alluding to the directions. The structure will burn.",

When we burn the Petunia, the main rows, made of paper, will burn away, and the outer row will collapse, taking on a new shape around the frame, and giving us a new sculpture.\r\n\r\nIn the information age we live in, surrounded by data, big and small, there is certain poetry to using newspaper as building material for a cocoon-like structure. He who sits inside the Petunia will be completely enveloped in data, which has been printed to paper and then encrypted beyond recognition by the yarn-making process and the knitting.\r\nCopies of all newspaper issues used, will be available on site for the curious reader.",

Da Vinci would appreciate the Fibonacci sequence expressed by the Cleu with circles in the ratios of 1, 2, 3, 5. The labyrinth provides a contemplative experience on the playa, a special place where participants can take as long as they like to walk individually or with others on the intertwining circular paths representing the miraculous synchronicities of Consciousness, Life, Earth, Universe. Just beyond the colorful pinwheels and flags of the labyrinth, the artist/scientist/mystic in you can view the fascinating panoply of creativity on the playa. Within the labyrinth, participants find a calm center, a space for musing and meditation, or a peaceful moment of At-Onement. In a magical box at the base of a large Cleu, participants may find a clue to their own lives or even be led to CleuCamp where they can get a polyphonic Cleu brainwashing & copper Cleu pendant.",

Grove is a meditation on the interdependence of breath. Every time we breathe in, we inhale the 'out breath' of a tree around us, placing ourselves in a constant state of union between the macro-forest outside, and the micro-forest of alveoli within our lungs. \r\n\r\nGrove uses technology related to the quantified self, to break down the idea of self entirely and to remind us that we are all interconnected, through breath, to every living creature on this planet; from the leaves on trees to the sand of the desert.",

The focal point of progress will be a spinning bicycle (the entire bicycle, not just the wheels), held up by a geodesic dome, and powered by two residental sized solar panels. Extra power from the panels will go to USB and 120V plugs for people to plug their varyous technological advances into.\r\nProgress will engage its viewers by creating a space for meditation on the the \"point\" of continuous technological advancement through an utterly useless spinning bicycle. Through this self-reflective process, we hope that people will realize that they don't need to plug in their iphones, and will leave our pointless project in search of internal contentment.",

Fabric canopies adorn each tree offering a sheltered daytime embrace & an irresistible beacon to Deep Playa Moth Peoples by night. Along the central axis, aligned with Wednesday morning's rising sun, The Haiku Booth marks the eastern counter point.  The shade trees are gathered to evoke casual interaction between visitors, while the Haiku Booth & integral mailbox is set apart to instill a creative breadth in which to write haiku on postcards.  Serving perhaps as a memento of one's adventures or a gift to a loved one, the postcards are themselves a component of a greater 'mailed art' installation now in its 4th year, associated with Kamp Kimono.  The post cards are read aloud at camp (see event board) and later mailed to their designated recipients mid year.  The best of which are bound into books for Kamp Kimono visitors to enjoy throughout the week.",

We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?  Actually, who are you not to be?  You are a child of God.  Your playing small does not serve the world...  It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone.  And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.  As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.  ~Marianne Williamson",

    "description": "Celestial Mechanica is a glimpse of our solar system that is only allowed by means of an artistic lens that we are providing for you. Because of the massive scale of our solar system it is very difficult to imagine what all of it looks like working together as one. Celestial Mechanica will allow us this privilege. From a distance it may not be clear what we are looking at but as we approach it becomes instantly clear what this is. First we step into a loosely fenced area that is for pedestrians only where all of the Gas Giants are whirling above us. As we get closer to the Sun we can see the Rocky Planets at eye level spinning around their orbits around the Sun. It is now time to step up onto the catwalk via 4 staircases that lead up to an elevated walking area where we can really view the complex mechanics, feel the heat from the Sun's fire effect and see the orbiting Rocky Planets, now slightly below us and separated by a handrail so that we do not disturb their delicate orbits.",

The sign itself is made out of reclaimed sheet metal and discarded letters from dismantled corporate signs, hand painted, lit by 300 ten-watt incandescent bulbs and securely attached to a welded base with wheels (and sometimes, pedal-power) so the piece is fully mobile across the playa. You can usually find the BORING sign accompanying burns, alongside popular art projects, and framing the silhouette of the Man at sunset. With four 500-watt speakers and a playlist of danceables from the 60s, 70s and 80s, the mobile, rolling sign often attracts an entourage of sunset or late night boogie revelers.",

This is how we learn compassion and love.\r\nIt is interactive as a meditation or hang out place, people can also stand in the middle of the portal where the symbol of infinity knot exists and experience sunlight, starlights, reflected lights or fluorescent lights, depending on the time of the day. You can also just hang out between the wings of the space, watching the flickering lights, as it creates a magical environment either at day or night.\r\nThe size of the installation will be about 28' in diameter and 12' tall. It forms a hexagonal shape with dark fabric dividing each sections. \r\nDuring Burning Man I am planning to create a quiet ceremony each day.",

The signs are inconspicuous to the undiscerning eye, but rich in symbolism and context of the issues that face civilization today. This subtle, yet thought-provoking installation invites social commentary on the unfortunate truths hiding just below the surface of society's awareness. \r\nWhat is this sign pointing to? What does it convey?",

Gifting: Lavishly painted, padded, and decorated, this bench conceals gifts to curious sitters\r\n3. Decommodification: This bench is created entirely out of reclaimed and re-branded materials\r\n4. Radical Self Reliance: Trash fence. Lincoln log style DIY bench\r\n5. Radical Self Expression: Two benches facing each other with rotating speaking/listening horns mounted on sticks in between them\r\n6. Communal Effort: An ornate and regal carrying litter provides an elegant sitting space\r\n7. Civic Responsibility: A small shelter holds a safe space for the weary traveler with 3 low benches and a table\r\n8. Leave No Trace: A clear plexiglass bench sits in the center of a light up zen garden\r\n9. Participation: What is a Teeter-Totter if not a huge communal bench?\r\n10. Immediacy: This bench is mobile.

It is a journey of discovery and a descent into a subterranean world.\r\n\r\nA path winds up to the Narthex at the eastern Pyramid and from this vantage point, the inward descent begins. Ancient relics of a collective history grace the walls as shafts of light illuminate effigies and offerings. These are moments in our primeval memory, inviting us further downward and inward into ourselves. The journey culminates in an inner sanctum-- a sanctuary of veils-- a confluence of concealment, revelation and sublime beauty.",

The garden is adorned with sculptures and ornate flowers that represent the principles by which humans may ascend the spiritual path to enlightenment. The geometry and symbology of the garden is based on the Kabbalah Tree of Life.\r\n\r\nRising from within the pool are larger than life flowers that represent beauty/sun, foundation/moon, and death. The flowers are brightly colored during the day and at night are transformed by fire effects. Buttons are located along the pedestals and benches to allow participants to change the strength and patterns of the flames within the pool and surrounding sculptures.",

Upon closer exploration, one dome is a gallery abuzz with science and experimentation. In the other, discover a telescope 8 feet tall where Burners can view planets, distant nebula and galaxies.  Outside the domes is the Open Air Planetarium, where eyeballs will fondle naked eye planets, while hands fondle a 4.5 billion year old meteorite. \r\n\r\nA tourist office for the rest of the universe, the secrets of the universe are revealed by powerful mirrors, optics, experiments, art, performances and interactive exhibits.\r\n\r\nThe sphere is the universe's answer to the form problem.

For instance - recycled shovel heads make up the breast plate for the belly of the dragon! Come out and see for yourself. And often times Gabe the artist or his beautiful daughter will be there to share stories on how and why it came to be!",

    "description": "At first look Horizon Lines appears to be a cluster or 'forest' of twenty five wooden posts rising out of the Playa. The top portion of the posts are painted black, with a golden line between the black and raw wood sections and the sides of each post painted to a different level. When Participants come to the properly marked location looking directly North, South, East or West at the sculpture, the painted portions visually align with the horizon or mountain range behind it. The golden stripe  creates a gilded horizon line. The moment the paint on each post and the natural backdrop line up, you will see the optical illusion of the merging of the foreground and background to make one whole image.",

Vibration as the main expression attempts to point at the interconnected nature of the universe. Sunrise, Sunset, and colored light animate painted climbable surfaces. The top half of an S curve is produced by combining 28 wooden boxes acting as resonating chambers for the harp portion into a curved climbable staircase. The bottom part of the S curve is steel pipe bent into multiple curves and welded together producing a flute like instrument for the wind, and a percussive instrument for human interaction. LED spot lights with slowly phasing color create animated night views with the painted portions of the instrument. Citizens interact with Vibraj by climbing on, viewing changing color patterns, plucking, strumming, singing with, and pounding out rhythms. Designed to give the wind a voice Vibraj expresses via the elements.",

    "description": "Jar of Sand is a large-scale (8' tall x 4' diameter) canning-style \"glass\" jar filled with plastic collected from beaches of the Pacific Northwest. By engaging people to clean up our oceans, Jar of Sand intends to create awareness and encourage action. Domestic garbage and pieces of garbage from the Pacific Trash Vortex\u2014the massive island of floating trash\u2014are carried across oceans and wind up on our shores, telling a story of resource extraction, production, and consumption. In this time of climate change and excessive use of fossil fuels, this art installation is a reflection and commentary on our plastic consumption and ultimately unsustainable waste. Participants are welcome to bring plastic that they have collected from the ocean and beaches to the playa and put them in the Jar. The collected plastic will be creatively layered in an over-height custom fabricated jar that will be displayed at Burning Man .",

    "description": "An homage to Cadillac Ranch.  In 1974 the artists collaborative Ant Farm buried ten Cadillacs in the Texas prairie, leaving only the tail fins visible.  Cadillac Ranch has come to symbolize the demise of the dinosaurs that brought the American automobile industry to the brink of extinction.  The emergence of the nose-section of a zero-emissions vehicle turns the image of Cadillac Ranch on its head.  It suggests that, after a transformational journey through the bowels of earth, the automobile is being reborn as an environmentally-friendly descendant of gas-guzzling ancestors. \nhttps://www.instagram.com/electricrenaissance/",

    "description": "The temple this year will be built in the tradition of David Best temples, but with a significant departure from his usual style - this temple will be hand-built without CNC cut materials. It will be extremely ornate, with a large interior altar and a large chandelier. This temple will take on an ancient air, patina'ed with organic water-based stains, and look as if it were built hundreds of years in the past.\r\nThere will be 8 altars placed around the courtyard, which is walled off to create a protected, quiet, respectful space. The interactivity will be the usual function of the Burning Man temple: it will be a place for the community to come and express their emotions, reflect on the losses of friends and family members, and celebrate the lives of people around them. The temple will be built with the consideration of the community, with adequate space to accommodate the needs of people in the temple and the surrounding courtyard for reflection, safety and privacy.",
