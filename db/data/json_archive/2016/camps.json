For Da Vinci's Workshop, we are proud to present the historical 1627 Florin coin, from the Republic of Italy. Originally struck in gold, ours is gold colored in rich bronze. Hand carved in green wax by Sumner Silverman, one side displays the beautiful \"fleur-de-lis\" symbol. The reverse, is St. John the Baptist, outlined in negative space cells for the resin. BM 2016 is carved on the side of the coin. This project and the stories we learned about other jewelry for the last two years, was the inspiration for the book \"Jewelry of Burning Man\", published in 2015.

We use comedy, colors, fabrics, technology, style, relaxation, architecture, games, gifts, and anonymity as tools to elevate our visitors' experiences from the standard \"DJ on a stage\" setup seen elsewhere. Our stage, is the SAVAGE ARENA - an environment that breathes with its performers and cradles its listeners. Find shelter from the wind, dust and sun inside its robust structure and flexible skin. Find an elevated perch to watch the sun rise and set through the horizon. Find a hammock to sleep or a daybed to rest. Find a bocce ball, give it a toss. Find a beer to shotgun, and some tits to motorboat. Find a jungle gym and climb. Find a wheel with questionable dares, and spin it. And while you're exploring, listen to our music, watch our lights, find your friends, and lose your minds -- together.",

In addition to daily and nightly events, we will also be serving food and drink which we have discovered along the way.  And what of your travels?  Do you have stories to share with us?

We integrate ancient esoteric teachings of tantra with modern self-development techniques to create a unique environment for experiences that prepare the ground for evolution. To envision and prepare the world of tomorrow we need to rewire our nervous systems and free ourselves from the old paradigm. Tantra is an accelerator of evolution. The context of Burning Man serves as an amplifier to these ancient Tantric techniques. The collective ambition towards freedom present during Burning Man is unique. It erases differences between individuals and supports the Tantric effort of transcending all false dualities. From regular morning energetic practices to one-of-a-kind ceremonies and ritual, Tantra Mantra embraces and promotes the change towards a new human agreement. We leave a great place for spontaneity... Expect the unexpected.",

We've been the home of the Magic Kurry Cart, Sangria Soundclash, BRC Hip-Hop Playa Ball and Bugaboo the MV over the years. We're here to bring a taste of San Francisco's Mission District to Black Rock City. Don't forget to check the book for MCC's 2016 events like the BRC Hip-Hop Playa Ball and the Sangria Soundclash!",

As burners begin or end their adventure into open playa, they can stop by the disc golf course 24/7 to throw some discs through our glowing nine-hole disc golf, trip out under our 10' tall mushrooms, or grab a drink and relax in the Gopher's Hole during happy hour.\r\n\r\nWe'll be constructing a trippy forest to act as obstacles for the 9-hole disc golf course. The disc course will be open for play all of the burn, with LED discs for night play. The forest will be made different fun obstacles and will include 15' tall tye-dye trees to 10' tall mushrooms to dozens of 3' mushrooms, all of which will  light up bright for the fairies to prance through deep into the night.",

It is said that Da Vinci possessed an unusual amulet that he always kept close to him.  We wish to empower participants with similar protection and positive energy.  \r\n\r\nEntering our dome, our guests are invited to emboss letters, numbers, and symbols onto a brass plate (aka dog tag) or a brass disc; creating an Amulet to carry with them around their neck, or perhaps to gift to another.",

Come visit an illuminated tribute to human attempts to fly, from the fanciful ideas to modern aviation.

Test your knowledge of aviation, and you may find yourself flying around the playa in the Black Rock Air Force F-15 Interceptor that calls Above The Limit home. \r\n\r\nBy night, enjoy the colorful lights, popcorn, beverages and music while you contemplate soaring off into the stars and beyond. Fly safe, may your journey be epic, and we look forward to welcoming you back aboard.",

The Station also has a FM radio station at 90.9 on the dial to send communiqu\u00e9s to other planets.  Our team consists of multiple scientists, philosophers, physicians, and engineers who give lectures on planetary sciences, biology, neuroscience, and more.  A portable lab is set up for conducting experiments in chemistry and biology, to help educate travelers on terraforming technologies they'll need in their emigration.
