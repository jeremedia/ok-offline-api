The citizens of the city named it \"The Cube.\" Two individuals were called forth by the vibrational waves that surged through the dusty grounds, emanating from this unearthly material. They were encoded with unique information that sent them through a black hole to an intelligently inhabited planet, \"Arcanum-9.\" There they were given mathematics and language to bring back to the people of Earth, to show them mysteries of consciousness. Two crystals, one black and one white, are intercepted by a large stone carved with unique alien language and translations. Three guides ground the magnetic field, respectively representing the passage of mind, body, and spirit.",

It takes the form of a huge rearing cobra with a coiled body, a beautiful copper-scaled head topped with a magnificent crown, and a spreading hood. Her body is a hooped structure that invites climbing and play, appealing to the child in us all. \nQueen Cobra references the ancient shared mythologies of many diverse cultures. Specifically she represents the awakening of Kundalini, a form of divine feminine energy, which is visualized as a serpent uncoiling from the base of the spine and ascending through different levels of mystical experience until it reaches the top of the head, leading to a profound transformation of consciousness.",

The prisms are attached to an adjustable mount on a 4 ft pyramid. The direction of the beam is aimed by volunteer \"Beamers\".\n\nThe Art occurs when Observers see the light and there is a Beamer aiming the beam to the Observer. As Observers see the light, a fraction will be drawn to the beam origin where they become Beamers.",

    "description": "Loosely based on desert plants this sculpture strives to understand and recreate the forces of nature. The piece is very industrial in appearance with the sheer steel facade and plastic bubbling light fixtures, and so, the elements of nature are represented by the gradual shift in color of the light and the ever persistent shrieks and thumps of the sound. Just like the vibrations of life, this sculpture's life force will pulse through it in a slow and melodic manner. The piece, although beautiful during the day, is dormant, only coming to life as the sun sets each night. People are inevitably be drawn to these representations of energy forces and so the sculpture and its surrounding environment will inevitably become a serene social space.",

There's some intense stuff going on here.  Hopefully more-than-enough treats to stimulate those in the vicinity.",

    "description": "Awakening is both a large scale articulating sculpture and an immersive camera obscura that represents our coming into existence. As a large scale articulating sculpture the piece is comprised of three separate related structures; the head facing toward two hands rising out of the ground. \n\nThe human body is the most highly engineered object in existence, a machine of uncountable parts and unfathomable function. Its workings have served as inspiration for all of humanity's greatest inventions. This work serves as an homage to two most amazing mechanisms in that machine: the human eye and hand. They represent what separates us/life from the rest of the universe, the ability to observe the world around us and manifest change in that world.",

    "description": "P\u0101daPagoda is a 27\u2019x21\u2019 double-layered kinetic pagoda which explores the dynamics of social interaction, interdependence, and expressions of AAPI heritage outside of Asia. The experience of being Asian American often leads to the formation of a presentable facade, one which masks a deeper expression of our true emotions. The feeling of inner turmoil tucked away is represented in the construction of a rotating inner core built within a static envelope. A climbable ladder at the center of the core is available only to those who can find their way into the heart pillar and ascend amidst the movement, symbolizing a journey of grounding into one\u2019s truth regardless of external influences. The majority of the structure is created from bamboo, a sustainable material which has roots in many Asian countries. This piece creates an interactive third space where aspects of our cultural heritage can be re-imagined and shared.",

Its wings are hinged so that they flap, propelled by the wind or by participants operating a lever. 38,000 LEDs cover its surface. As speakers play classical and classic pop music, images choreographed to each section are displayed on the LEDs.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the butterfly is bent aluminum tubing. Aluminum strips are across it, onto which are glued LED strips. Each wing has a front-to-back axle around which the wing pivots. These axles are angled so that the front edges of the wings are higher than the rear edges. This allows a gust of wind to push the outer edges of the wings upward. They come down when the gust abates. Thus the wings flap even when there are no participants move them manually.\r\n\r\nApproximately 38,000 full-color, computer-controlled LEDs cover the bottom sides of each wing, surround the body, and run along each antenna and leg. These are controlled by several computers.\r\n\r\nThe four speakers surrounding the butterfly are disguised as giant flower pots with LED flowers growing out of them. The flower are touch-sensitive, changing their animations in response to a visitor's attentions.",

The provocation dares participants to defy with a boogie, shuffle, or strut, and perhaps even gather together into a sweaty, rhythmic rebellion.\n\nGround mounted spotlights cast enlarged silhouettes of dancers up onto the letters, broadcasting the disobedience across the playa. Crowds thus magnify their energy, sending out ripples of mischievous joy, and luring in reinforcements.\n\nApproaching reveals smaller text on each letter, a true story of someone's collision with a rule and the consequences: banishment, termination, expulsion, or incarceration. If the tincture of joy and grief give way to a desire for restorative justice, then Over Ruled's goal is fulfilled.",

The swing then becomes an experiment in creating cooperative motion.",

The sculpture is fabricated from a myriad laser-cut sheet metal plates welded together. The face is rendered in sharp detail with eyes closed in dreamlike rapture. The hair flows back in the wind. The skin is made of reflective stainless steel heat treated to a rich gold color. The surface of the sculpture is outlined by geometric tattoo-like perforations that accentuate the shape of the body and emit light at night. Wings made of golden stainless and patina'ed steel stretch upwards from the back in a dramatic pose. Touch the Sky serves as a visual metaphor for taking leaps of faith to achieve our dreams and fly.",

    "description": "This piece is a combination of several things, but first the construction is a very simple combination of eight, eight foot 4 by 4\u2019s laid out like the spokes of a wagon wheel.  Then there are eight, eight foot 4 by 4\u2019s standing up right at the end of each spoke.  They will all be supported by using hemp rope as guide wires and the lack of any solid areas will mitigate the sail affect which might blow the piece apart or collapse it in place.  The center has a smaller statue with rope connecting it to the tops of each of the perimeter 4 by 4\u2019s.  The majority of the piece is biodegradable with metal brackets and bolts to hold high stress points together.  There will be solar lights on top pillar, in the ground where every guide wire is anchored and spotlights in the columns focused inward.\r\n\r\nThe concept or statement is that the government is able to any program they wish, in ways that allow for very little input by the community.  The center sculpture is smaller in size and represents the government project.  The ropes leading from the top of the outer columns represent input from the community.  And the best part is the interaction between the artist and the attendees in that the artist will be teaching her art of folding used books into various articles to be hung from the connecting wires.  The smaller sculptures are intended to represent the community\u2019s support or aversion to the government project.\r\n\r\nImagine the community peacefully fighting the government\u2019s desire to construct a geothermal drilling rig in their unspoiled back yard by connecting all of their thoughts together and focusing either positive or negative thoughts from on high.",

With seating placed around the fire pit, the installation invites participants to relax, reflect, and connect with each other amidst the chaos.",

The harbinger of peace attracts visitors by breathing out gusts of icy-cold CO2. The cooling blasts encourage community and comfort in the unforgiving desert heat. As the evening visits BRC, so will a mechanical owl. The spirit being rescinds as the bringer of death emerges, trapping her inside his body. The owl then embarks on his quest to scorch the skies with his bursts of flames. He raises the wings he stole from the spirit being as he beckons an audience to witness his fury. He shoots flames to remind us that life is fragile and we must answer the urgent call to unify before death arrives.",

Adorned with hand crafted masks, the beings display otherworldly creatures, unique and strikingly surreal. A representation of who we are as part of the animal kingdom and the different masks we wear for protection and preservation. Rooted in the center, a merry-go-round awakens the inner child and creates a visual shift in perspective. From stillness to chaos, step into this playful realm to face your beasts and experience the transformative power of self-love.",

We will then witness a small shoal of humans who discuss through light signals to a shoal of squid.

Our supports, or ball and chains, often are not who or what we thought they would be.

It encourages visitors to contemplate the sacrifices made by these individuals and the significance of community, support, and dedication.\r\nThis installation, composed of a cluster of anti-tank hedgehogs, forms an abstract figure that evokes both an animal hedgehog and a looming thundercloud, which often carries a foreboding threat. For Ukrainians, these anti-tank hedgehogs symbolize protection and unity. During the early days of the war, ordinary Ukrainians created thousands of hedgehogs from three sections of iron I-beams welded together to safeguard their communities.\r\nInside the Temple, visitors can uncover stories of war victims who dreamt of attending Burning Man and pay tribute to the thousands of courageous and talented individuals the Ukrainian creative community lost due to the war. Through this installation, the artists seek to express gratitude for those who lost their lives defending their homeland and those who continue to stand guard. The Hedgehog Temple represents hope and resilience, reminding us that the human spirit can triumph even in the darkest times.",

Under midnight's velvet curtain, explore the question of what it means to be human by offering a personal story to \"the Entity\" and in turn receive the stories of others. Emerge from this journey transformed. In lumine lunari es renascentis. In moonlight you are reborn.",

This social art brings the participation, expression, and the importance of respecting future generations by only leaving our trace in the dust. Tugging at our sense of nostalgia, enthralled in curiosity for spirograph art, is made possible only by community participation. This human art displays the ever forgiving cycles of creation and destruction, change, impermanence, and silence. Snailing Around is based on the the idea of folks getting together for art, not knowing what they are getting into, and still creating anyway.",

He who makes things sprout and ensures that natural cycles of life are preserved. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn most creation myths, Gods created humans and Gods created animals.\r\nAs we are all descendants of animals, it was in fact animals that created humans and humans that created Gods. \r\nThis piece explores an alternative Creation Myth, one that laments the human-animal separation and recognizes the sacredness and kinship to all lifeforms, past and present.\r\nWe, like all living beings, are the legacy of multiple evolutionary cycles.\r\n\r\nAs cultural contributors, we often create with materials that outlast our lifetime.\r\n\r\nThe ethos of the artwork is to create in the most eco-friendly way possible to take a stance against modern society's make-use-dispose consumption model.\r\n\r\nThe piece will be lit with solar energy and built with reclaimed, recycled, upcycled and biodegradable materials reducing its ecological impact. \r\n\r\nParts of this installation were grown from 60 lb of mycelium,\r\nwhich in the right conditions will biodegrade.\r\nMycelium is the earth's largest and most ancient organism, \r\nthe root of life and the great recycler of nature.\r\nIt is an alternative sustainable material to combat the plastic and toxic waste we are facing globally. \r\n\r\nThis method of Bio-Art practice creations are deemed ephemeral.\r\nAre we ready for this form of art?",

At night they bathe in soft yellow light reminiscent of the sunlight collected all day.\n. \nEach is a self-contained 1600 Watt solar charging supporting other art projects. Instead of generators artists buy batteries & charge them each day at The Solar Library. This allows artists to convert to solar power without the cost, fumes & engineering of placing panels next to their art.\n. \nA whisperia flower out front tells the story of the art projects in each unit when a handle is cranked like a music box for spoken word.",

In a white, English-speaking world, artists from other backgrounds are pressured to make themselves legible to the dominant audience, often at the cost of deeper self-expression. With Loss in Translation, we evoke a vision of a world without a lingua franca, finding beauty in the diversity of human expression at a time where the machine of global capitalism commodifies, homogenizes culture and accelerates the death of languages around the world.",

The drum is surrounded by mannequins dressed as Burners with their heads in the sand. There's a small doorway; inside adult hands emerge from the interior walls holding oil covered babies, as if strangling future generations. The infants hold children's art from around the world, drawings and paintings illustrating how climate annihilation causes terrifying personal distress, the extinction of favourite animals, the danger of forest fires. A lectern in the drum interior, dramatically lit, has a phone to record a response to this question: \"What will you tell your grandchildren about what you did to stop the fossil fuel death machine?\"",

Inspired by traditional East Asian temple architecture, its sweeping curved roof line and cantilevered roof joinery will interplay organically with the contours of the mountains surrounding BRC. Within the temple a wheel circumscribed with all sixty four hexagrams of the I Ching can be spun -  when the wheel comes to a stop, a unique fortune is communicated to the participant. The FFT inspires people to consider themes of free will, predestination, and the illusion of reality. How does one face the invariably changing seasons of life? How do we have free will if there is no self?",

This moment inspired him to share his secret project for the first time. He invited her to become art partners and thus The Dream Briefcase was born. It includes pinball-machine inspired Beings headed towards the Steps of Ascension, representing humanity's journey in the Great Awakening.

From afar, the structure looks like a pyramid; from above and up close, it resembles an \"x\" (or the man symbol!). At night, AoA is backlit along its borders with LEDs. During the day, the sun passes through the panels, casting colored shadows and cutout patterns on the ground.",

The inspiration was to capture the unique self-expression that is such a huge part of this week long event. \n\nTo really get the best feel, reaction and emotion possible I wanted the prints to be life size.  So that as someone approached and looked at the portraits it felt like that person was there in front of them.  Helping translate emotion through scale.",

We will transform the space into a wild grown thought journal, featuring written thoughts and black and white psychedelic drawings, beautiful tapestry walls, and immense greenery. There will also be options to stargaze and relax on any of the hammocks and revert to your inner child, while you swing on the swings or rock climb your way to the galaxy.",

At the heart of Temple Anam Cara lies a deep belief in the unity of love, light, and consciousness\u2014a recognition that all ancient traditions converge in their quest for higher truth.

    "description": "To our ancestors, the Empyrean was well known as \"the highest heaven\". It was comprised of \u00e6ther\u2014or fire\u2014and thought to be made of celestial beings of pure light\u2014the source of all creation.  The concept of Entheos\u2014or \"the creator within\"\u2014puts the power of Empyrean creation into human minds and bodies. It endows each of us with the capacity for self-authorship: in the creation (or re-creation) of self, and of community. The Empyrean Gate is a sixty-foot diameter shaded structure lofted 21-feet in the air, with a 13-foot 'gateway' at its center, aimed at the Empyrean. At night the structure pulses with light issuing from a radial array of 25,000 computer-addressable LEDs connected to reactive software and interacted with by participants",

Through the delicate craftsmanship and imaginative playfulness of the paper rabbit, we are reminded of the power of art to reveal the hidden depths of our souls, and to illuminate the beauty and mystery of the world around us.",

This work visualizes a longing for an ideal world, where man does not try to oppose nature, but feels its heartbeat and breathes in unison. Turning empathy to a maximum, one hears the subtle vibrations of the earth, reads the emotions of trees and grasses, understands the language of animals and birds, knows what fish are silent about.\nDisguise, mimicry, and camouflage here are not just a way of hiding, of blending into the landscape, but a way of trying on the image of the other. An opportunity to become different, to think more broadly and to feel more deeply.",

People still gather at the pyramids to celebrate the cycles of the sun and moon and reflect on the mysteries of the universe.\n\nVisitors to Solunis are invited to enter the larger pyramids and to bask in the warm glow of the sun. At night, the pyramids are illuminated with LED lights, creating a mystical and otherworldly atmosphere that transcends time and space.  The installation will inspire others to reflect on the mysteries of the universe, and to find beauty and meaning in the natural world around us.",

People can sit or stand or lie down under the spider or in the surrounding area, while watching or listening to the chimes.

    "description": "Emerging from the desert floor, a 6 foot wooden and silver fox will greet all the citizens of the desert. Curious about the revelry and city, it will touch down onto the playa and bless us with its mythological presence. No ordinary winter fox, this is a fox that has visited us from the cold tundra of the north, its tail still lit in the brilliant blues and greens of the aurora borealis, which, legend has, our fox is responsible for creating by simply being its curious and frolicky self across the winter desert of the northern hemispheres. Every drop of snow it flicks into the atmosphere becomes the colors we see.",

To show their appreciation for the years of gifts the playa has provided, they are building this art installation for the citizens of Black Rock City. They have chosen to create a tree, but build it out of scrap metal. This contradiction represents the combination of two opposite elements, organic plant life and non-organic metal. The uniting of opposite forces is inevitable in the coming together of persons. As the saying goes, opposites attract. Akin to a marriage, a tree can provide protection, nourishment and a safe space to grow and play.",

Geometry is the basis of art and language, it is the starting point of who we are as a species. But it is not the end of who we are. Expanse is a reminder that our solace and burgeoning reside in both the honoring and challenging of geometry. That we live best when we become the ground where rigidity and expansion meet and resolve.",

    "description": "Axolotl Frequency is inspired by the creature's unique ability to regenerate its body through the power of its heart, connecting to the very essence of life. These art pieces aim to express the importance of protecting this endangered animal and symbolize the power and wisdom of the heart. Two sculptures of 13 parts engineered to create a realistic depiction of an Axolotl, giving the impression of floating on water while the body and tail emerge from it. Intricately designed skin with transparent sections will allow internal light to shine through, enhanced with stained glass, mirrors, and gems. The chest section will have a transparent opening with internal lighting that pulses with a simulated heartbeat simulating its heart frequency.",

It is a Tensegrity Cuboctahedron which has been used in scientific studies of cellular motility (motion!). Its daytime appearance is ephemeral. The rigid members of its structure appear to be floating unsupported in space. It glistens and gently deforms in the breeze. Its vibrant night-time appearance alludes to the ways in which signals within our cells manifest our intentions as animals.",

The installation's audio-reactive capabilities reflect the collective heartbeat of the Burning Man community. Light patterns range from abstract shapes to minimalist representations of life and energy, resonating with Burning Man's spirit of creativity, self-expression, and community in a stripped-down interplay of light, space, and perception.",

As more people interact with windows, these reverberations overlap to produce new colors and patterns that can reach out to the entire space. \n\nThis piece reminds us to acknowledge perception of reality is based. on interactions with the environment and with each other. It encourages us to play with how we see each other, how things look different based on who we are and where we are at in our lives.",

    "description": "Yaza is a project by Simone Engelen, who lived in a zen buddhist mountain monastery earlier this year to experience life as a monk.\r\n\u201cEvery morning at 12AM we would start singing sutra\u2019s followed by long meditations throughout the entire day. We would end the day with 'yaza', the final meditation done outside. Even though I was exhausted, Yaza was my favorite part of day. Lit by moonlight I would wrap myself in a sleeping bag, sometimes hearing a fellow monk snore in the background or 'tanuki's' (a kind of racoon) trashing the graveyard, and it was in that very moment I would realize.... wow, how incredibly grateful am I to be alive. Ever since I've been eager to share this experience with others!\r\n\r\nTo try it by yourself, please sit here at night. Straighten your spine. Focus on the breath. And take it all in.\r\n\r\nTo experience it with me, please join me on Wednesday August 30, on a fullmoon night at 3 AM, for a guided silent meditation at Moonlight Collective\u2019s \u2018Prairie of Possibilities\u2019.",

The sign itself is made out of reclaimed sheet metal and discarded letters from dismantled corporate signs, hand painted, lit by 300 LED incandescent(ish) bulbs and securely attached to a welded base with wheels (and sometimes, pedal-power) so the piece is fully mobile across the playa. You can usually find the BORING sign accompanying burns, alongside popular art projects, and framing the silhouette of the Man at sunset.",

After taking the first step, though, it then flowed freely from within and led to many joys. The citizens of Black Rock City are similarly invited to heed Van Gogh's advice to \"just slap something on it\" and paint this canvas with light.",

The heartbeat pulses at a rapid rate, and when held in our hands, it begins to slow to a relaxed pace. In this way, we pray for and honor the spirit of the horse. Horses have sacrificed for us and carried us physically as well as emotionally and continue to do so today. Horses hold our hearts within their own field when we are in their presence. May we hold them in return and may each holding of the heart be a prayer for a return of balance and diversity to the lands we all call home, and a restoration of freedom of sovereignty for the equine spirit.

Various mediums of Steele's signature signage surround the fireplace with a carefully curated selection of empowering messages on road signs and a marquee boards. There is also a series of mirrored road signs with impactful messages for endless self-reflection. The last piece of the puzzle is a \"Complains Box\" with a neon, a interactive way of expression and communication.",

It rotates slowly and is essentially a stage for performances, rituals, and ceremonies. The experience is emceed by the lead artist, Ginny. Music, lighting and audio will be provided by the artists' camp, where the piece will be placed (Kostume Kult - 6:45 & Esplanade). The idea  is to create  a container where participants feel safe and empowered to embody The Divine Slut within. Anyone who would like to come up to the altar will be given the opportunity to express themselves through movement for the duration of one song. While participants are performing on the altar they will get to experience being worshiped and exalted by those who are watching. There will also be electric votive candles available so that folks who would like to make an offering to the sluts on the altar will be able to light and place a candle at the altar.",

The visitors can enter the bull in the rear of the bull through a small slit in the fabric. Once inside there are two benches where they are invited to sit and see a large stained glass window titled \"Plastic Ocean\", a 75 foot long painting of a herd of mammals, and a hanging altar piece that utilizes sacred geometry.",
