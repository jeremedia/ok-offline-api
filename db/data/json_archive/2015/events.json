Our collection of international DJs spin smooth beats until nightfall.\r\n\r\nWe also give revelers a chance to clean up with our Soul Power Showers; guests experience the rebirth and rejuvenation of cool, cleansing water sprayed forcefully from our pressurized washer system (imagine a water saving car wash inside our shower areas for guests). Baptized anew, heroes set out on their way spreading positive vibes.\r\n\r\nDJ Lineup:\r\n-Marques Wyatt\r\n-Nicodemus\r\n-Deep Woods\r\n-Sabo\r\n-Rafael de la Cruz",

    "description": "This workshop is about working with the magical, creative energy of Burning Man to create a plan-of-action to bring your unique offering to the world.  When you are holding onto your creative expression, your gifts, your particular genius, or pretending not to know what it is, it's gets very uncomfortable after a while. It will start itching inside of you to be created in physical form, it's deepest desire is to be born out of the dream space. You came to Planet Earth to share this, now is your time. Calling all healers, conversation-starters, rebels, light-workers, and medicine women. This workshop is broken down into four magical sections. \r\n\r\n1) Connection. How relating to others is the number one function of your business or passion project. We begin the workshop with getting connected on the soul level to your fellow sisters.\r\n2) Reclaiming Your Unique Brilliance. Refining your message and creating something in the world that is unique, contributive, and that people will pay for. \r\n3) Healing Your Relationship With Money. Girl, if you want to start or expand your business, you've got to look at your drama and trauma with money. What would it be like if money flowed to you with ease? What would it be like if you could actually receive it? We will dive into this exploration together.\r\n4) Closing Ritual. Our closing ritual will include a beautiful ceremony to hold each others intentions and desires as we go create in the world. You will be let into a \"light-share\" experience.",

The tours are flexible so feel free to join us on playa if you see a bunch of bikes traveling in a pack, or drop out if you want. The tour starts promptly at the bike racks across from the ARTery (on the Esplanade). Note that there are also ART TOUR - Guided tour (search Playa Events), and self guided tours (paper copies) available at the ARTery. Most of the art on the playa is self-funded, so be sure to check out your favorite art projects on the Burning Man website now, and then help fund them or volunteer through their respective websites.

    "description": "This is an informative and participatory \"mouth-on\" workshop where we'll have a chance to ask questions, compare notes, share techniques, and generally learn from each other to be more skillful at this thing we love - or want to love - to do.  If you're interested in learning more about how to please a man orally, this is the place for you. . . . . . \r\n\r\nCome on ladies / givers, you know you've got some skills - and some questions!  Come share your favorite tips and techniques by words and demonstration.  If you're still exploring getting comfortable, or are curious about details you never dared ask anyone, come share questions that have been plaguing you. . . . . . \r\n\r\n\t* How to protect yourself when the action gets intense? . . .\r\n\t* What about the gag reflex? . . .\r\n\t* Drool or dry?  . . .\r\n\t* How do you use hands and still go deep? . . .\r\n\r\nAnd guys, you must have comments you'd like to pass on, other than simply \"Yes, please\"! . . . . .\r\n\r\n\t* Hate teeth?  Want teeth? . . .\r\n\t* What about deep throat? . . .\r\n\r\nHere's your chance to make your requests - and pet peeves - heard! . . . . .\r\n\r\nThis is a participatory event open to couples of any combination, so long as one of them has some phallic protuberance and the other is applying lips, tongue, and maybe even throat to it.  No lookie-loos!  That said we also strongly welcome women still getting comfortable with giving oral pleasure, with or without a partner.  This is a really safe place to ask questions, in the group or in private conversation afterwards. . . . . .\r\n\r\nThis was a great fun event at previous Burns.  The presenter's been researching all year to find new tidbits and info to share.  (Hey, someone's gotta do the tough jobs.)  Come show off, learn stuff, and have fun. . . . . .\r\n\r\n(Please bring a towel or sarong to lie on for your comfort.)",

Now in its 10th year on the playa, A Plus D bring BOOTIE BRC, the internationally-infamous bootleg mashup party, back to Black Rock City!\r\n\r\nBootie BRC celebrates (and satirizes) pop culture both past and present, keeping your brain guessing and body dancing with creative song combinations. Mixing and matching every musical genre, era, and style into one big dance party, it's the soundtrack for the A.D.D. generation -- with free mashup CDs given away like candy!\r\n\r\nLaunched by DJ duo A Plus D in 2003 in San Francisco, Bootie was the first club night dedicated solely to the burgeoning artform of the bootleg mashup, and is now the biggest mashup event in the world, with regular parties in several cities on four continents. Bootie BRC is presented in part by the BRC Weekly, Black Rock City's independent newsweekly. \r\n\r\nBootie ... because one song at a time just isn't enough.",

Now you're wondering, \"What the hell was I thinking?\" Don't leave the playa wishing you hadn't done something, or conversely, wishing you had, but didn't have the communication tools to ask for what you wanted. Communication is sexy, consent is sexy, and good boundaries make all the difference between having a great experience and wishing you could, turn back time. SexPositive World has developed  fun and interesting exercises that help you get in the habit of feeling into what you really want, asking for that, and gently and lovingly saying no when preferable. If you're not sure, we've got great negotiation techniques to teach you how to get to a situation that is a win-win for all concerned. These are skills that will be with you, long after the playa dust settles: you will find yourself using them, not just in areas of sex and relationship, but with your family, friends, and employers too. Class size is limited to 30 participants. Join Gabriella and the other \"sexperts\" and love perveyors at Play4Play and get ready to have the experiences YOU want. Class recommended for women and couples, but good for everyone!",

In brief: we choose a location, sit and write for ten minutes or so, share what we have written, and move on to another location. The only response we give to each others' writing is \"thank you.\" \r\nWe will likely depart from the Midway around 3:50 after we get ourselves organized and sit down to \"write out the cobwebs.\" Participate for as long as you wish.

Fear sometimes get embedded deep in our psyche and will remain there until and unless we choose to address them. Granted it is easy to ignore our fears and stay in the comfort zone, yet imagine life's possibilities if we confront our fears. In this workshop, we will breakthrough our fears by breaking an arrow with our throat as a metaphorical exercise. It can be fear related to us growing up as queer individuals or any other personal fears that gets in our way to becoming our full two-spirit beautiful self. Participants must be sober to participate. Limited arrows available. Led by Blitzy.",

Through chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, an individual is able to awaken this enlightenment the Buddha revealed and reveal their own Buddha nature. A practitioner of this Buddhism, through chanting and study, can transform their life and create a state of unshakable happiness, overcoming the sufferings of birth and death. Buddhism is a practice and everyone is welcome to join. Each day after chanting, together we will study a Buddhist concept, answer questions, and share experiences about the practice and its application to our daily life. All are welcome to join us.

    "description": "It has happened to us all.  You're having a great time, easy and happy, dancing through the weeds of your own small life, and suddenly -- a clown.  He's trying to be funny at you.  He's a burlesque.  Or a Bozo.  Or a body comedian.  You can't punch him because that would be wrong.  You can't cry because you're terrified.  And you can't laugh because the life has been sucked out of you.  So you push it down, deep inside.  Where the clown trauma festers in its own silent and pressurized tank of suppressed rage and fear.\r\n\r\nThese incidents have been seen with increasing frequency as clowning has infiltrated our community.  Clowns are easy.  Clowns are anonymous.  Clowns are everywhere.  And clowns are dangerous.  They are the death knell of participation culture, just as the deadbeats were the death knell of hippie culture.  They embody the cheap, the quick, and the easy, and they should not be allowed to take over.\r\n\r\nCome to our shaded bar and snack on our snacks with us.  Learn the story of clowns, past, present, and future.  Drink your health in a clown-free zone.  Crush the red nose of clown oppression.  And embed a new mantra into your soul: \r\n\r\nI will never be clowned again.",

    "description": "The Cocoon is performed architecture. Inside the Cocoon we physically create the space and structure with our bodies. Chanting, dancing and other ritualistic strategies will generate a massive collective energy. No experience necessary!  For the generally creative and outgoing. It manifests a collective spirit as we create a sacred space for transformation and rebirth. Inspiration, identity and rebirth take morphing, sculptural form. The Cocoon is a hand-crafted stretchy fabric enclosure created by Sherry Aliberti, an architect and performance artist based in New York City. Structurally, these postures represent a scale model of an architecture and materiality based on the forces of the body. The Cocoon Project is a multi-disciplinary collaborative performing the Cocoon with movers, live projected visuals and soundscape. The performed-installation conveys a primordial one-ness of many bodies within the sheer membrane. CocoonNYC performs site-specifically in galleries, music venues and alternative spaces. The Cocoon experience can be emotionally powerful for every age and/or background.",

Then it moves you into a deeper state of consciousness and closer to your individual and collective soul\u2019s purpose. Utilizing dance, contemporary shamanism, hands on healing, drumming and global music, this powerful and beautiful soul work sheds inhibitions and heightens inner awareness in a safe and carefully monitored group setting. Dancers are blindfolded in the shamanic tradition and step beyond their conscious fears and limitations and allow their innermost creative sides to break free. Dancers tune in to sound and movement to take an inner journey exploring a trance-like state of self-discovery and self-realization.",

Become present to desire, aware of sensation, and connected to your own sexual rhythm, with just 90 minutes of simple meditation, breathing, and yoga practices. \r\n\r\nIf you are thinking about being sexual as part of your Burn, why not start by tapping in to the most authentic expression of your sexuality possible. Pleasure, connection, love, and joy, are all possible, but you will likely need to move through layer upon layer of story and conditioning to access that. Breath, meditation, and yoga are some of the keys to unlocking the vast treasure that is your sexuality, and in this morning session you will be shown the way.\r\n\r\nThis session is highly recommended for women and for couples, however, no one will be turned away.\r\n\r\nAlex is a full-time yoga teacher in Venice, California. She is a surfer and a total love. Gabriella is a tantric teacher/sex-positive ambassador/and event organizer, who spends her time between Portland and Malibu.",

Do you have the stomach for dialogue such as this?\r\n\r\n\"The vile stench of the Shaman's hot fetid breath over came the nauseated female with a deep soul searing sickness, causing her to wrench her head backwards and regurgitate a slimy, orange white stream of swelling gore over the richly woven purple robe of the enthused acolyte.\"\r\n\r\nIf so come to the reading of the \"Eye of Argon\" written 35 years ago and has yet to be forgotten in the sands of time.

    "description": "False Profit, Inc., sent shock waves through the stock market with its recent announcement of current plans for its annual Tuesday Night Party (TNP) at The Burning Man Arts and Culture Festival. In a move outside experts are hailing for its boldness and freshtasticness, False Profit, Inc., released news that it would be holding the event not at its desert research field campus proper, but \u201cout in the open.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor 14 years, we\u2019ve invited shareholders to our desert campus to celebrate with us,\u201d said Jef Pearlman, Senior VP of Auditory Logistics. \u201cThis year, we decided to think \u2018outside the camp.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nCiting ever-increasing attendance, bicycle parking challenges, and the desire for attendees to experience high fidelity sound \u201cen plein air\u201d as forces pushing the party into the open playa, , a spokesperson for the company enthusiastically predicted that this year\u2019s TNP would be \u201cthe best evar.\u201d\r\n\r\nReferring to the unanticipated relocation, an unnamed insider also hinted that the main research facility is so filled this year with mad science projects--which shareholders will undoubtedly wish to keep a watchful eye on as conditions evolve--that the decision to shift was \u201ceasy peasy\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe party will be held on the open \u201cplaya\u201d approximately 300 feet out from the company\u2019s primary campus location of 5:15 and Esplanade. This location was chosen due to the giant deep sea fish that will be located there, which analysts expect will protect attendees from wandering shirtcockers, newbs, darkwads, those rich people who are destroying Burning Man, and other unsavory characters. Known as Illumacanth, the fish will delight and astound party attendees with its spikes, lights, and fire. Sound for the event will be provided by the legendary Dr. Brainlove, a project of The Phage, a long-time affiliate company and co-conspirator of False Profit.",

From gazing mindlessly out through the window in elementary school classrooms, to blissful meditations, or exploring the universe via medicine journeys as adults, we need to be free to consciously travel out-of-body. We are residents of many dimensions. To function and contribute in the everyday frequencies, we need to be grounded but not limited. If we can achieve even a brief moment of higher consciousness we have the ability to recall the experience, regenerate it via appreciation, and reenter these same spiritual realities using creative imagination. This also means that we can dial our conscious awareness back down in order to focus on the physical world and appreciate its finer aspects. \r\nThis is the life of the \u201chouseholder\u201d who visits the Mountain Temple of higher consciousness and brings its wondrous vibrations into the local village or city as a balanced human being. \r\n\r\nwww.higherselfdiscovery.com",

    "description": "My camp, the Free Photography Zone, has been doing portraits of the participants of Burning Man continuously for the past 19 years.  Each person, or group, is photographed in a studio setting and given an instant print as their tangible reminder of their Burning Man experience.  I then photograph then on medium format black and white film so that, if they wish, they can get prints at a later date.\r\n\r\nThese are not a re-do of your high school yearbook portrait just in Burning Man attire.  I try to give each person enough time to help me make a lasting photograph.  On our gallery walls in our shade structure there are black and white prints ranging in size from 16x20\" to 4x5' that I hope will be of some inspiration to you.  Though I try not to duplicate what I have done in the past they may serve as a jumping off point for our photography session.  Not the easiest thing given the approximately 47,000 black and white negatives done so far.  I have never counted and see no reason to start now.\r\n\r\nI consider the people I photograph as the most important part of any photograph and always try my best to make a photograph that will be of lasting value and interest well beyond the moment of its creation.\r\n\r\nCome, join me, and together we may make something wonderful.  \r\n\r\nI usually begin each day about 10 or 11 AM and continue into the night till I can't keep on my feet any longer.  Weather permitting I'll begin on Sunday August 30th through Saturday September 5th.\r\n\r\nI do look forward to photographing you.",

That\u2019s right! It's baaaaaaack! How hot can you take it? Spicy, savory, and DEFINITELY alcoholic, join us for even more bacon, even bloodier marys, and some lovely bottoms for all to view (ask before you fondle!)! Bring your own cup to Camp GTFO (location TBD) for the best*, hottest*, and TASTIEST* bloody marys and goodies on the Playa! . (* dustiest; let's not kid ourselves.) There are usually other food goodies available, as we see fit and depending on how drunk we got the night before/that morning. We'll also have our famous Hydration Station for those who aren't drinking or for those under 21 (because they can all still eat BACON, right?! Shush, it's a rhetorical question.) . Also revisit the ARE YOU A BLOODY PUSSY OR WHAT? bar, and see how hot you can take it when Gemini pours whatever the hell she damn well feels like into a shot glass for you to drink. Want to earn YOUR red wings?! Have a seat in our living room, dance the morning away in Tiny Club, play on the trampoline (clothing optional, of course!), or write in the shared journal!

The person giving the gift/kiss is almost never the person the receiver exchanges their item with. \r\n\r\nParticipants can come and list what they want or may have to gift/kiss. If a participant doesn't have something, we'll provide a gift of their choosing. Then using a trade-loop algorithm a web of exchanged items is created that pairs participants with gifts they want.  For those who only wish to give, we photograph them and give their item's recipient their photo/information to potentially interact with later. \r\n\r\nAll exchanges/kisses are executed daily at noon. Please come before or after to browse/list or join in the chaos of the exchange!",

The most interesting practice would be turning your thought toward him for a few minutes without speaking and enjoy drinking in this small silent space. I always serve this tea for whoever sits down in front of me. Red Tea Ceremony -YOU ARE GOD- is always a great tool to communicate universally without any thought of hierarchy.

    "description": "Hotshot the Robot returns to celebrate the 10th anniversary of his 1st birthday. No singing, he hates that. Don't offer him a beer, he hates that too. \r\n\r\nHotshot was born Friday during the 2004 burn near the 3:00 plaza.\r\n\r\nIt is with heavy heart he returns to the place of his birth after a nasty bout of losing himself in a search of fame and fortune. \r\n\r\nIt was only after locking on to his self-reflection in a pool in the Hollywood hills, high on some kinda smack did he see what he had become. It was one of those infinity pools that seems like it falls away to the surrounding landscapes. They got really trendy in the middle to late 90's and this one in particular had really nice cultured stone placed to look completely natural almost...\r\n\r\nA pool of robo-flection, falling away to nowhere...in this case it happened to be the gorgeous smog filled sky overlooking the 405 south and the 101. \r\n\r\n\"What have I become?\" he whispers to himself whispering back at himself.  \r\n\"Why am I wearing this amazing floral print burgundy kimono robe?\" which was actually made for him personally by one of the finest seamstresses in the Sai Kung district of Hong Kong. \r\n\r\nHe had been had by himself having been had. \r\n\r\nNo more. It was time to get back to what mattered most in Hotshot's life. I mean after all, no skeezer in all of Orange County could tighten his nuts half as much as The Burn had in the past. Just because he doesn't have feelings, doesn't mean he doesn't have feelings. \r\n\r\nThere is no shame in going.........home. \r\n\r\nHotshot immediately logged onto his brand new Macbook Pro with the 13.3\" HD Retina screen and made his first steps towards the playa and logged onto Stubhub and bought a ticket for $1175.00. After his friends said he couldn't fit his bean bag chair in their ride he went to ebay and purchased a car pass for $389 (free shipping) and folks the rest they say is history. \r\n\r\nCome say hello old friends and new friends alike. 3:00 plaza all week, only God knows when.",

    "description": "A 90-minute workshop introducing Thai massage theory and techniques to anyone who would like to enjoy being able to offer their benefits to friends and family. No bodywork experience is required.\r\n\r\nThai Massage is an ancient bodywork practice which combines acupressure, energy meridian stimulation and yoga-like stretching. This is an Ayurvedic version of Shiatsu which encourages great relaxation and rejuvenation. The recipient, fully clothed on a floor mat, continues to remain passive, while gently and fluidly, yoga-influenced stretches are applied to them. There are many positive effects including stress-reduction, increased flexibility resulting in injury prevention, muscle spasm relief and the treatment of a wide variety of orthopedic complaints. This work is also a conscious, meditational application of Metta (love and compassion) that leaves both the giver and receiver with a life-affirming feeling of peace and connection.\r\n\r\nJennifer Gillmor is a Senior Practitioner at Thai Massage Toronto, a Holistic Table Massage Practitioner and a Yoga Teacher at Yogaspace in Toronto, Canada",

For those trekking across the barren wasteland, evading the dozen or so security and law enforcement agencies, avoiding detection by radar and heat sensors, struggling to finally reach the perimeter fence; our Bar is there to offer you an ice cold beverage and welcome you Home with a hug, brother/sister, before contacting the proper authorities and turning you over to security.\r\n\r\nFor several years I have rode my bicycle with trailer out to the furthest point in Black Rock City with all the booze, juice, water, soda and ice I could fit in the 3 large ice-chests. I purposely set up at the remotest spot I can find, away from camps, sound systems, art vehicles and crowds.  Trying to provide a service to intrepid playa explorers, people out riding bikes along the trash fence, those reaching beyond the EDM to see the desert vastness. As they spot our stack of coolers along the fence, in they trickle and find Iced Cold Margaritas waiting for them. Every year we go through every drop of beverage we can carry out there, usually in under an hour or two. Hosted by Camp Threat.\r\n\r\nBring a cup and witty banter. Join us at the fence.\r\n\r\nAnd, YES, most definitely, Daft Punk will be playing.",

    "description": "Start your evenings with the most intense laughter you can experience. We laugh for no reason, other than for exercise, and health. Relieve stress and pain, promote natural healing, and create spontaneous bonds of friendship through group laughter. It\u2019s fun! The brainchild of Dr. Madan Kataria in India and practiced by millions worldwide, Laughter Yoga combines Unconditional Laughter with Yogic Breathing (Pranayama). Anyone can Laugh for No Reason, without relying on humor, jokes or comedy. Laughter is simulated as a body exercise in a group; with eye contact and childlike playfulness, it soon turns into real and contagious laughter. The concept of Laughter Yoga is based on a scientific fact that the body cannot differentiate between fake and real laughter. One gets the same physiological and psychological benefits. Find much more info online by searching on Laughter Yoga, but come! Enjoy!",

Come for an early hour of low impact exercise in the Longevity Stick Art (LSA) discipline of 12 low-impact exercises to build balance, flexibility, strength, mental focus, breathing capacity, and vitality, and open your points and channels. Bring your water or hydration liquid. We\u2019ll provide sticks for you. Master Mai Bac Dao developed Longevity Stick Art discipline while he was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese. He helped his fellow prisoners restore and maintain health through LSA, and vowed if he was ever freed, he\u2019d dedicate his life to spread its benefits, with the proviso that no trainer could ever charge for it. (Like \"gifting,\" eh?) He was freed, moved to Southern California, and taught classes of students and future teachers. Today, weekly classes abound in So Cal, around the US, and the world.

Mead is the oldest alcoholic beverage known to man & we aim to share with you how easy it is to make at home. A honey based wine, mead requires a very small investment on your part. The variations of style are endless as you can make mead with fruit, ciders, herbs, different kinds of honey, dry or sweet, (i.e. has remaining sugar),  bubbly, (like sparkling wine), or still. We will explain how to make it, where to get it, and even have demo equipment available. 21+ and over can sample different varieties we've made and brought to share. You will come away with an understanding of:   Early Discoveries of Mead,  Mead in Religion and Culture, & the Techniques of Making Mead: -Overall concepts that mixing water, honey and yeast starts a reaction to convert the sugars in the honey to alcohol and release carbon dioxide gas. -The equipment needed such as a 1, 3 or 5 gallon water bottles, airlocks, tubes to siphon off the mead from the \u2018lees,\u2019 (sediment at the bottom of the fermentation container), bottles, and a few other items such as cleanser to keep everything clean. -Selections of honey to make mead and how the type of honey influences the end result flavor and the same for yeast selection. -Selections of \u2018adjuncts\u2019 which influence the flavor of your mead: the addition of spices such as cloves or cinnamon (known as metheglin), or the addition of fruits such as raspberries or strawberry (melomel).  We will finish up with tasting different styles! Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!",

Johnny was an integral member of the New York City Burning Man community and a loving \"playa mama\" to his campmates at Love Potion and Duck & Cover. We plan to toast him with a Happy Hour at Love Potion, then migrate to The Man, where some of his ashes will be in The Man's heart. From there, we will erect our memorial to him in The Temple and, finally, travel to deep playa to scatter his ashes at sunset. It will be festive and filled with joy, just as Johnny was. For us, it will be as if he is joining us on the playa one more time! Bring bikes and booze!",

I have 18 years coaching authentic self-expression, including 4 TEDx talks. 22 years studying people / human interaction via songwriting (and expressing my findings artfully). 28 years as a performer in various capacities, especially singing. In my career I've presented music and talks for over 100,000 people. Also, I've spent the last full year doing a deep dive into femininity/polarity studies. I am an advocate for men being empowered (especially as women claim their power more and more), and attaining the capacity to leave legacies. This includes knowing how to navigate matters of the heart. Overall, I really LOVE showing men how to feel happy and free professionally, publicly, and personally by learning how to express themselves authentically. So much of this revolves around a man's ability to limit drama and distraction in his life.",

We'll sense and feel the way that energy moves through the body with Qi Gong practice. We'll explore somatic training and the Body/Mind practices of Developmental Movement and Experiential Anatomy. We'll investigate our relationship to form, space, and each other through Viewpoints Space Awareness and Mudra Space Awareness. \r\n\r\nThis class is a laboratory where we'll be working with the energy that animates our bodies. We'll be exploring how energy moves when the body moves and how mind can direct energy. We'll learn to harness the power of the breath and focus of the mind to attain higher performance outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe work is toward attaining a greater depth of expression of personal energy, achieving grace and ease in a variety of movement patterns, developing an equanimity of all body parts as initiators and supporters of movement in space, and gaining the ability to dance ecstatically with great amounts of energy without loss of awareness of where you are and what is around you. \r\n\r\nEveryone is welcome from dancers seeking to bring contemplation into their dance - to those wishing to bridge their sitting practice to their walking meditation practice to the rest of their active lives - to people who have never danced or meditated before.",

    "description": "Imagine, you\u2019ve just met someone you\u2019re highly attracted to. You\u2019re having a wonderful conversation and you feel the excitement building in your chest.  You\u2019re at the point where you know you want to take it to the next level. It\u2019s the moment of no return. This moment of tension is both one of the hottest moments of attraction and potentially one of the most awkward.  \r\n\r\nHow do you know if the other person is at the same desire level? How do you assess their openness to touch, to a kiss, or more? A kiss or initial touch is relatively low stakes, but what happens when things heat up? What happens when you\u2019ve just overstepped a line and can feel their withdrawal?  \r\n\r\nThese nuanced moments of initial sexual attraction can be the hottest of our lives. But we\u2019re never really taught how to navigate highly sexually charged moments with someone completely new.  What does it mean to fully take responsibility for these moments so that when we\u2019re done everyone involved feels totally awesome?   \r\n\r\nIn this workshop you will get a much deeper understanding of the nuances of initiating and negotiating hot and sexy connections. \r\n\r\n-Boost your sexual self-confidence\r\n-Know how to feel your \u201cfuck yes!\u201d and your \u201cOh no!\u201d and everything in between.\r\n-Understand when and how to bring up \"the conversation\" so you don\u2019t deflate all the sexual turn-on!\r\n-Gain clear sexy communication skills to keep it hot while still conveying important information.\r\n-And learn the number 1 reason why these skills will make you the sexiest person on earth!",

By holding, rocking, and cradling each other, a direct path is formed to deep and visceral experiences of nurturance. Some of the movements we do induce mutual trance states by using repetitive circular motion. A hug that evolves into a spiral that is so safe and supported that we enter graceful states of consciousness. If you are looking for ways to enhance your relationship with your partner, this may be useful. Relating in non-verbal, non-linear fashion can have an effect of breaking through barriers of relating on new and different levels. People report that using these methods deepens and re-invigorates their relationship.",

    "description": "we're very excited as this will be Playfully Yours 14th year on the playa. We have expanded our play area with more than doubling the size. We offer an outdoor play area, a covered open area, and new to our camp, an enclosed area offering privacy out of sight from passerbyers. We invite everyone but especially beginners and those curious about BDSM play to come and play in a safe, non-pressured, and supervised environment to learn and experience dungeon play. As our name implies (Playfully Yours), we focus on the lighter, more sensual, and playful side of BDSM. The dungeon is well equipped with 3 St Andrews Crosses, a seated cross, 2 benches, a kneeling spanking/flogging bench, a standing spanking/flogging bench, a suspension station, 2 padded saw horses, a standing/kneeling stock, an 8' chain spider web, and a petting cage. We offer several toys to come and experience and play with such as feathers, a variety of floggers, paddles, crops, pinwheels, fur gloves, and a violet wand. Our personnel are available to provide instruction and demonstration on the safe use of the equipment and will supervise all play. We also have a lounge area where you can relax and meet our campmates while checking out our camp. The lounge has a spanking bike, a corn hole bean bag game, lounge chairs, a mini bar serving our cherry bombs for those over 21 years old with id, as well as, a spinning wheel to facilitate participation.  There are also daily scheduled classes with demonstrations and audience participation. We'll have an Intro Into Dungeon Play and a Shibari Sexy Body Rope Tying classes. We also have gifting of collars, paddles and patches. Our hours accommodate those coming in an play both day and night, generally from noon to about 3 am.",

Most people spend a good deal of energy trying to ignore the images that flood their internal screens, clutter their minds and stir up their emotions. But throughout the ages, there will always be creative people who practice opening the third eye in order to see into the depths of this world and to explore other dimensions. Craig will teach powerful ways of opening up one's awareness to higher vision to receive insight and to shine with healing light.\r\nThis workshop will offer practical techniques for developing an enhanced ability to see psychically while being supported by intuitive sensing, the inner voice, and sensory feelings for verification. You will also learn methods for seeing energy, viewing facial changes that reveal past lives, perceiving spiritual beings, and gazing into a portal to higher dimensions - all with your eyes wide open. \r\n\r\nwww.higherselfdiscovery.com",

The default model for relationship in our society, monogamy, makes explicit the underlying belief that Freedom and Love exist in opposition with each other.\r\n\r\nBut what if our desire for Freedom in relationship is covering a deeper desire, namely that we want to know, and be assured, that we can speak and honor our deepest Truths, and Desires, even, and especially, while in we are in Loving committed partnerships. So what if, instead of talking about Freedom, we talked how to create a relationship where it's safe to speak our Truths, including all of our desires (even for others), and know that we will still be Loved?\r\n\r\nJoin us for a conversation about how open relationships can be created from a place deep Love and commitment to Truth.",

Then join us at Camp Beaverton in our Beaver Dome for this workshop. We will open with heartfelt sharing about our relationships with masturbation, address the stigmas faced in society, and open ourselves to understanding why and how we pleasure ourselves. Once we are all comfortable, we will start exploring our bodies. We will keep our hands to ourselves and power up our bullets, magic wands, rabbits, or other fun battery-operated toys. We will not be able to provide much AC power for the Hitachis so if you have an extra generator, please bring it to help charge up those in need! Safer sex supplies like lube, gloves, hand sanitizer, and condoms will be available. Cum take a ride with us! Women/Trans identified only please.",

We promote a no pressure relaxed atmosphere where you can get naked or not. Nude is not lewd so uninvited touching is prohibited. Come by for a cool drink where you can sit and chat or meet new people. Enjoy our classic rock atmosphere music and a little shade in the heat of the day.

Our BUMPER CARTS are custom designed and one-of a kind! It's like driving your own personal pedal powered art car for 3 minutes or however long you last. The TENT is a SHADY OASIS in the DAY and a LIT-UP BEACON of fun at NIGHT!\r\n\r\n Winners of each race are determined by a mysterious mix of whatever the announcers at the time deem worthy. Is it the number of rear end or T-bone collisions you make happen? or maybe how many crashes you nimbly avoid with expert driving skills. Or maybe your winning attitude. Or your crazy costume. Maybe you cross the finish line first. Maybe you cross it last or not at all. You might still be a WINNER. We're betting on it! KIDS tall enough to pedal are welcome. Adults of ALL AGES brave or timid welcome. ALL Spectators welcome too! Come into the center ring and heckle your friends in the races!\r\n\r\nPEDALING is FUN but BUMPING is EVEN BETTER! Seriously, the bumpers keep you safe and you will laugh your ass off with every bump, crash, skid or pass. \r\n\r\nWe also welcome volunteers who want to help with PIT CREW duties! Wrangle the crowds, heckle the riders, keep the pedal carts repaired. Sign up for our newsletter on our FB page or just stop by anytime we are live on Playa!",

    "description": "The Pinhole Project exposes 30 x 40 inch sheets of light sensitive gelatin silver paper. We work with 12 pinhole cameras, created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. \r\n\r\nUnder the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject.\r\n\r\nWe maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited in Illumination Village, Center Camp Cafe, and off-playa.\r\n\r\nThe pinhole camp has been creating large-scale portraits with festival participants since 1999. The pinhole came about of the desire of four first time participants to contribute in a unique and lasting way to the ephemeral pleasures of the playa.\r\n\r\nAs we have grown, so too has our belief that this device is the reason that we make our annual pilgrimage. As we have evolved, so too has the camera, not only in functional and technical capabilities but also in its role as a seed of meaningful engagement with other participants.",

There is much wisdom in the poly community which can be helpful to people trying to make *any* relationship work, monogamous or Polyamorous. There will be a facilitated discussion in which you can get your questions addressed and some of the knowledge in our community can be shared.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to cool off and de-dust yourself after our tea party, bring a water donation to enjoy PolyParadise's famous Human Carcass Wash.",

Maybe it was a branch of a tree with a piece of tinsel wrapped around it? Possibly you\u2019ve been mesmerized by one of those floating jellyfish on Burn Night?\r\n\r\nWell \u2013 if the jellyfish is your thing then you probably need to come back for the advanced class next year. But random objects hanging from sticks covered in lights and glittery things\u2026 that\u2019s totally our thing! That, my friend, is what we call a \u201craving stick\u201d and no self-respecting raver should venture out onto the playa at night without one.\r\n\r\nCome for an interactive, playa punch-infused lesson in the art of raving stick making, featuring group discussions and plenty of one on one time with our experienced teachers. We\u2019ll round off the afternoon with a delightful presentation on the history of the raving stick - you simply won\u2019t believe some of the famous names you\u2019ll hear!\r\n\r\nRaving stick materials will be provided on the day by Celtic Chaos, but attendees are more than welcome to bring along their own personal additions. And the best part is that each person gets to leave with the raving stick that they make... but not until they partake in a collective stick-shaking rave-off inside The Castle!",

Do you want to reduce the amount of recycling you will have to pack out? Start by bringing all of your beverages in aluminum cans. Follow that by separating your your aluminum cans and other recyclables from any landfill trash. Bring your aluminum cans to Black Rock City Recycle Camp. We are located in Center Camp at 6:00, directly behind the Cafe. The camp is \"Open\" and ready to accept your aluminum cans Monday through Sunday, 9am to 5pm. Bring your clean, separated aluminum cans only. We definitely don't want your trash. We do not accept any other recyclables, you can take them to one of the 24 hour recycling stations on your way back to Reno, check out your Survival Guide for more information. We provide a sorting area to check your cans for anything that isn't aluminum. You can ride the bike powered can crusher and crush your cans. After your cans get crushed, you will put your crushed cans into the large containers at the camp. All proceeds from the aluminum are donated to the Gerlach K-12 School in Gerlach, NV. Come join in the fun while doing a good thing for the planet and Black Rock City..!!!",

Several Riders PEDAL AND DRIVE head-to-head around a 60 x 90 foot track under the gorgeous CIRCUS TENT with LIGHTS, MUSIC and ANNOUNCERS! Our BUMPER CARTS are custom designed and one-of a kind! It's like driving your own personal pedal powered art car for 3 minutes or however long you last. The TENT is a SHADY OASIS in the DAY and a LIT-UP BEACON of fun at NIGHT! Winners of each race are determined by a mysterious mix of whatever the announcers at the time deem worthy. Is it the number of rear end or T-bone collisions you make happen? or maybe how many crashes you nimbly avoid with expert driving skills. Or maybe your winning attitude. Or your crazy costume. Maybe you cross the finish line first. Maybe you cross it last or not at all. You might still be a WINNER. We're betting on it! KIDS tall enough to pedal are welcome. Adults of ALL AGES brave or timid welcome. ALL Spectators welcome too! Come into the center ring and heckle your friends in the races! PEDALING is FUN but BUMPING is EVEN BETTER! Seriously, the bumpers keep you safe and you will laugh your ass off with every bump, crash, skid or pass. We also welcome volunteers who want to help with PIT CREW duties! Wrangle the crowds, heckle the riders, keep the pedal carts repaired. Sign up for our newsletter on our FB page or just stop by anytime we are live on Playa!

We begin with a deep dive into our truth\u2014our true nature\u2014which is simply a letting go and a knowing of who we always already are, beyond our ideas about ourselves and others: a simple direct undeniable knowing of our clear deep heart-mind-being. \r\nWe will ground ourselves in this present moment and connect with our higher self and cultivate our intentions, desires, and wishes for the night.\r\nUsing movement, stillness, and humor we bring awareness and acceptance to ourselves and our conditioning.\r\nThrough simple spontaneous body movements you embody and express your truth(s) and your true being. \r\nFinally we move into connecting and relating with each other while staying connected with our self. This process will be facilitated with some simple relating exercises and is a chance to see through our ego and conditioned habitual ways of relating and being. We invite a sense of humor to simply seeing ourselves and the conscious and unconscious games we play. \r\nBringing awareness to our patterns opens the possibility of playing with them and responding from our clear deep heart mind space, rather than reacting. Respond from awareness rather than react from habits. We live from our true nature rather than our conditioning. We dance.",

    "description": "\"What is Rootism?\" My response to this in short: Rootism is a belief that the truth of our learned existence lies in the Roots of all teachings/truths and beliefs. These truths are different for everyone based on how they we raised and what we resonate with at the time of our learning. As a Rootist, we take the roots of various truths and incorporate them into our own mantra, our own way of living, to become the well rounded person that we wish to be. When you resonate with more than one truth, you are a Rootist. There are many different types of Rootist's. You could be a Christian Rootist, a Buddhist Rootist, or any type of Rootist. The moment you resonate with more than one truth & take the roots of those teachings as your truths, you become a Rootist.\r\n\r\nRootism is a lesson that I have learned and come to resonate with over the last few years. I am grateful to share this information with each of you. Please feel free to share this with anyone with whom you feel might be interested.\r\n\r\nAs an offset of Rootism, we have The Rootist's Way. A style of yoga that is in-tentful in it's design and sequences to help to facilitate a certain type of energy clearing and calling in of new energies.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this and for wanting to know more about Rootism.\r\n\r\nThe 8 Principles of Rootism:\r\n\r\n\u221ePrinciples of Rootism\u2122\r\n\r\n1. Release what no longer serves - nurture yourself & ground yourself\r\n2. Embrace a Creative Vision\r\n3. Move forward on your journey -Take Steps Fearlessly\r\n4. Empathize and Feel what is going on within you & others\r\n5. Motivate yourself & others by Truth \u2013 Check the Ecology of the Whole\r\n6. Bridge the Mind & the Heart\r\n7. Evolve a Pro-Sociality Lifestyle & Manifest a Greater Humanity - help others and give back\r\n8. Revolutionize - Reveal Yourself! Open UP! Inner Knowing is Outer Showing\r\n\r\nThe acronym is \"Remember\"",

WAY MORE DANGEROUS! and, MORE FUN!! So we will be exploring where assumptions come from and creating different pathways that have a much better chance for accuracy, and.... wait for it.... INITMACY! (yes that pot of gold we are looking for at the end of those playa rainbows!) In this space of curiosity, experimentation and practice, YOU WILL LEARN the emerging art of SUBTLE COMMUNICATION. You will be able to describe your month in Bali in seven (7) words or less in a way that creates more understanding, more curiosity and, yes, more intimate connection (every time) than your 90 minute slide show and endless stories. Really... \r\nAnswer the tiresome question \"How are you?\" in three (3) words that will say more, build immediate trust and help you to purge more friends on facebook than ever before! We all have the ability to 'know' more without using the left side of our brain. We just aren't so practiced. So, with a bit of science, a measure of technique, the willingness to try a 'different way' and a whole workshop of practice! we will be ready to immediately upgrade any relationship, including the one with the hottie you will meet tonight outside the Pleasure Dome!

I practically kidnapped a couple people who were spontaneous enough and kind enough to play along with the silliness. It was quite fun.

    "description": "Welcome to Swap Meat!\r\n\r\nThis event is organized by The Trustable Sluts: a community of sexually liberated socially responsible women.\r\n\r\nThis is a mixer for sexually liberated, socially responsible women* and the men and women (and everyone in between) who love them.\r\n\r\nWith Swap Meat, we turn traditional gender dynamics on their head and invite both men and women who want to date, relate and have sexual connections with women who identify as women* who are self-aware, sex-positive, love warriors.\r\n\r\nWHO ARE WE: trustablesluts.com\r\n\r\nThere will be little structure and much fun. We will bring something to identify the \"meat\" and identify Trustable Slut Members.\r\n\r\n# 1 rule of SWAP Meat is\r\nyou bring someone AWESOME\r\nto SWAP Meat.\r\n\r\nWe want to be introduced to more amazing people who want to meet fun, playful, and open women, who are in alignment with our values.\r\n\r\nBring someone who you would recommend to date your best friend. Bring someone who is \"available\" to date. Bring someone who has good boundaries and knows how to communicate. Bring someone who YOU are 100% okay with sharing.\r\n\r\nWho NOT to bring:\r\n-Some random person off the playa\r\n-Someone who is overly eager to hook-up (aka desperate).\r\n-Someone who isn't emotionally available or at least self-aware.\r\n\r\nOfficial Meat Policy:\r\n\r\n1) Meat can be of any gender.\r\n2) We encourage \"available\" meat. That word has many interpretations...it is whatever it means to you. However, here are some ways it means to us:\r\n+ is single or in an open relationship.\r\n+ their relationship agreements allow for dating.\r\n+ has time to date, meaning not just interested in hooking-up.\r\n+ has experience in our or some other community of sexy tribe.\r\n+ has emotional intelligence and communication skills.\r\n\r\n*NOTE: We are open to all gender orientations and sexual orientations. We are LGBTQ friendly.",

It\u2019s time for us to tell a new story of femininity, with our choices, with our self-expression, and with our lives. There are too few positive examples of women who are in full command of their sexuality and its attractive powers. There are too few healthy stories of women who\u2019s full creative expression is unbridled and uncontrolled.\r\n\r\nLearn how to harness the dual feminine forms and dual masculine forms of power in each of your interactions and become a true manifestor - brining your highest vision into reality through your being, your words, and your actions.You will learn an unforgettable map of your own sources of power, some of which have been lying dormant for your entire life. Once you can locate and allow all four faces of incorruptible power to move through you, you can lead, inspire, and serve almost anyone.

Watch what happens when permission is given to the darker, more playful side of one's self. That part that stays just out of sight, watching from the sideline, wanting to take part, but doesn't due to social constraint or peer reprisal.\r\n\u201cThe Game\u201d is both a game of chance and boundaries.

You\u2019re at the point where you know you want to take it to the next level. It\u2019s the moment of no return. This moment of tension is both one of the hottest moments of attraction and potentially one of the most awkward.  \r\n\r\nHow do you know if the other person is at the same desire level? How do you assess their openness to touch, to a kiss, or more? A kiss or initial touch is relatively low stakes, but what happens when things heat up? What happens when you\u2019ve just overstepped a line and can feel their withdrawal?  \r\n\r\nThese nuanced moments of initial sexual attraction can be the hottest of our lives. But we\u2019re never really taught how to navigate highly sexually charged moments with someone completely new.  What does it mean to fully take responsibility for these moments so that when we\u2019re done everyone involved feels totally awesome?   \r\n\r\nIn this workshop you will get a much deeper understanding of the nuances of initiating and negotiating hot and sexy connections. \r\n\r\n-Boost your sexual self-confidence\r\n-Know how to feel your \u201cfuck yes!\u201d and your \u201cOh no!\u201d and everything in between.\r\n-Understand when and how to bring up \"the conversation\" so you don\u2019t deflate all the sexual turn-on!\r\n-Gain clear sexy communication skills to keep it hot while still conveying important information.\r\n-And learn the number 1 reason why these skills will make you the sexiest person on earth!",

Vinyasa movements are smoothly flowing and almost dance-like, with synchronized breath and movements. Vinyasa has both mental and physical benefits. Physically, sweat expels toxins and re-energizes your body and can be an easy to challenging physical workout, mostly depending on you and where you take your practice. Mentally, the synchronized breathing relaxes your mind and helps to release any blockage of energy flow throughout your body.",

Are you over people asking why your body looks the way it does? Are you interested in creating real safe spaces for people whether they fit in the binary or not? Are you troubled by cultural appropriation on playa and the way some folks are treated as other or freaks in a way that doesn't feel good? Then this workshop is for you. This workshop is also for you if you want to delve into the intersections of race, gender, class and how these identities affect our experience at BM and beyond. Many of us come to playa to be free and our full liberated selves yet when we pass through the gate we have not dropped our baggage of racism, transphobia, sexism, abelism, and classism at the gate.  So let's be real and talk about how these isms affect our time on playa and off and what we want to do to create the world we want to live in. This workshop will be interactive, engaging, fun, and educational. Let's define what we want the word freakshow to me and let's reclaim ourselves and whole people who all deserve respect.",

Being an Author is looking at things as the creator and being responsible for outcomes. \r\n\r\nThis is especially valuable in a group like this where people are counted on to produce serious results, as the conversation is about clearing away self-limiting thoughts and replacing them with positive and proactive ones. However, this isn\u2019t a one-time cheerleading session, but rather an introduction to a simple yet revolutionary way of thinking about things that people can take with them.

    "description": "The Zendo is a community outreach project at Burning Man that offers education and psychological support, with the goal to help reduce the potential harms involved in drug use. Volunteers provide peer-to-peer harm reduction support for individuals having a difficult drug-related experience and who don't require medical care. Guests are sometimes actively on substance, and other times are seeking integration support, or education about the risks involved in drug use. We staff the space 24/7 with trained mental health and medical professionals who provide oversight, as well as individuals experienced in crisis response.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to come to the training to learn more about volunteering, it will take place at Something Freaky This Way Foams, near 2:00&G, on Tuesday September 1 at 11AM. \r\n\r\nThe four principles of psychedelic harm reduction include: \r\n\r\n1. Create a safe space - If someone is having a challenging experience try to move them into a comfortable, warm, and calm environment. If possible, try to avoid noisy or crowded spaces. Ask what would make them most comfortable. Offer blankets and water. \r\n\r\n2. Sitting, not guiding - Be a calm presence of acceptance, compassion, and caring. Promote feelings of trust and security. Let the person's unfolding experience be the guide. Don't try to get ahead of their process. Explore distressing issues if they want, but know that simply being with the person is supportive and talking may not be helpful.\r\n\r\n3. Talk through, not down - Invite the person to explore what's happening and encourage them to try not to resist it. Remind them that they are safe. \r\n\r\n4. Difficult is not the same as bad - challenging experiences can wind up being our most valuable and lead to learning and growth. Help the person integrate the experience, and remind them the experience will continue to unfold.",

    "description": "Join us for a guided creative visualization meditation. We will help you picture the perfect day 10 yrs in your future. The process works by subconsciously shifting your decision making over the next 10 years eventually making your vision a reality. You don't know what that day looks like? Don't worry, most people don't, but your subconscious already knows what is important to it. The more amazing and compelling the vision that you let emerge, the more you will be drawn to it. How? Most people make between 80 to 400 decisions a day. A rich, compelling visualization with a lot of sensory \"hooks\" can shift those decisions towards your perfect future because the right choices will feel \"right\". We will start with a mindfulness of breath meditation, a gratitude exercise and then wake up the morning of your perfect day and explore it through a guided process. After, we will ask a few of those interested to share their visualization with the group. We look forward to sharing your future day together. Dr.Feelgood",

    "description": "From the opening moments, we learn this solo show is about soul mates, and the search for love and lust. Emily is the hero of the story, a character very much a literary stand-in for author and performer Eleanor O\u2019Brien. We meet her as a child, fascinated by romance novels and her father\u2019s porn. The show traces her journey from awkward teen to college boyfriends, complete with disappointing first times and disastrous blowjobs. But then she discovers renown sex-columnist Dan Savage, her \u2018gay fairy godfather\u2019. Dan helps her learn to ask for what she wants (\u201cI can touch my own clit during sex?\u201d), and encourages her to be GGG (Good, Giving and Game). Emily goes on a spree of experimentation, culminating in the \u201cgrand prix of getting lucky,\u201d Burning Man. At the world\u2019s largest alternative event, she meets Matt, who turns out to be the love of her life-but he doesn\u2019t identify as monogamous. Can they make it work? Emily asks Dan for advice as they navigate the thrills and valleys of opening the relationship: how to negotiate boundaries, deal with jealousy and keep from falling in love with other people. She thinks if they follow the rules they've set, they can keep their relationship safe. They can be \u201cmonogamish,\u201d and keep the spark in their marriage. When a magical threesome drives her to utter meltdown, Emily insists on closing their marriage. But monogamy doesn\u2019t solve all their problems. Emily and Matt discover they have different libidos - and the seven-year itch isn\u2019t a myth. He encourages her to spread her wings, so she takes a lover. All's fine for a while, but soon she finds herself falling in love with Michael, her NSA partner for play. She is terrified of losing her marriage to Matt, and asks Dan again for advice. \u201cIs polyamory a utopian ideal?\u201d During an ayahuasca ceremony, Emily finally sees where she's been blind to how her behavior has stifled her marriage, and how she has to let go of the need for certainty, or controlling anyone else\u2019s heart.",

Now a part of the Cult of the Magic Lady!\r\n\r\nCome plop yourself down on a couch... or on a fellow burner... or on a fellow burner ON a couch..  Enjoy fresh popped corn in the middle of nowhere.  Programming varies but, with a library of terabytes of entertainment onhand, is bound to be... entertaining to someone.  Bring a friend!  Or two!  Maybe even three, but let's not overdo it, we usually don't have THAT much room.\r\n\r\nEveryone has to grow tired of nonstop raving now and again (I think... Do you?  Honestly, I wouldn't know... Never really was my thing...  Which is why I run a theater... in a desert..  Oh crap, I think I may have gotten off track...) so take a night off and JOIN US...\r\n\r\nFree intoxicants for the kids!  (No, not really... I'm actually just amazed at how many characters I'm allowed to type in this section...  Really.  I've only just passed the halfway point.  Isn't that nuts?  How are you to be expected to come up with so much to say, really...?)\r\n\r\nPrevious nights have included: Dude Night (Tron, The Fisher King, The Big Lebowski), Musical Night (Repo: The Musical, Tommy, Suck)... Some nights we don't even HAVE themes!  (Because, you know... Burning Man...  Plans vaporize!)\r\n\r\nSo be sure to visit us at some point in your travels.  You can also get yourself loaded at the Koi Lounge, and of course HAVE AN ABORTION... Or two... Or three! (You slut, but we don't do shame because.... What's the point?)",
