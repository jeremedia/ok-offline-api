Made anew for Burning Man 2015, the massive endeavor of exhibiting this new 1/4 mile A Walk Through Time is being undertaken to show Burners the reality of how long humans have been on this planet, and how quickly we have changed it in the last 100 years -- a mere nanosecond in the timeline of Earth's history.

We took a lot of inspiration from the Book of Tea written in 1906 by Okakura Kakuz\u014d of Japan in English, he addressed the growing concern of clash between the east and west cultures.

We dare you to come sit in the Bad Advice Chair. You may even find yourself in the middle of an impromptu flow jam or fire spinning session.

Half the moves are with your partner, half with everyone else, resulting in a tribal vibe (stomping, clapping, and hooting), where the Zen is flow, synchrony,and bonding - playful, flirtatious, all ages, possible for many disabled, community oriented, inclusive and noncompetitive - if you are smiling, you are doing it right, and everyone who shows up can have fun.",

Our response is that humans can discover their true nature through yoga and meditation. Self-discovery is a process of lighting up the mythic metaphor of the \"rainbow bridge.\" Anodea Judith writes that \"on our journey through life, the chakras are the wheels along this axis that take the vehicle of the Self along our evolutionary quest, across the Rainbow Bridge, to reclaim our divine nature once again...to restore the Rainbow Bridge is to reconnect to our own divinity, anchoring it in the world around us and healing the rifts that so plague our world.\"\r\n\r\nIn interacting with other burners, we would like to focus on 7 chakras over 7 days. We will offer a daily practice tied to each Chakra leading up to the lotus / crown / diamond chakra the day the man burns.",
