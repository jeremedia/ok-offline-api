Have fun interacting with a large scale art piece and make a memory to take with you! \r\n\r\nThe interactivity inside is designed to be discovered. Solar powered, touch sensitive pads will be placed throughout the frame. As people interact with the frame, the sound and lighting activate, encouraging contact, imagination and exploration. \r\n\r\nThis piece is in honor of my Abuela, Rosamelia, and is an opportunity to acknowledge the incredible support that I am so grateful to have had growing up and to pass it on. To inspire self expression, to call up the performer, the artist, the brown sheep and the nut. I imagine the joy that will happen as a result of Got Framed to be a mirror of her gifts to us.",

The labyrinth provides a contemplative experience on the playa, a special place where participants can take as long as they like to walk individually or with others on the intertwining circular paths representing the miraculous synchronicities of Consciousness, Life, Earth, Universe. The swirling colors and sounds of the playa just beyond the colorful paths and flags of the labyrinth make a backdrop for the fascinating panoply of creativity on the playa. Within the labyrinth, participants find a calm center, a space for musing and meditation, or a peaceful moment of At-Onement. In a magical box at the base of a large Cleu, participants may find a clue to their own lives or even be led to CleuCamp where they can get a Cleu brainwashing and copper Cleu pendant. Like the rube at a carnival, Include the Cleu simply offers a fresh perspective, inspiring wonder and delight.",

While felt acutely in Alaska and the Arctic, changing water resources will affect the global community. As researchers, scientists and artists flock to the North, we look to the South, seeking to expand this dialogue in the unlikely yet poignant location of the Black Rock Dessert. Beach Front is an interactive light installation inspired by the role of water in a rapidly changing global climate. A suspended canopy of lights that mimic a sheet of water, Beach Front encourages participation from viewers and natural elements like wind, examining the interdependence between humans and natural forces. Each human-generated ripple illustrates our influence on the rapidly changing water that surrounds us; conversely, able to function solely on wind input, Beach Front acknowledges nature\u2019s ultimate autonomy and self-regulation.",

As visitors approach, they see that the disc is a form familiar to many, a message to spacefaring civilizations. The Emissary includes real messages sent into interstellar space, which may be intercepted by distant civilizations thousands of years hence.  It is also the portal to the Black Rock Observatory.",

Geometric structures and repeating patterns are the building blocks  everything in life, from our grided city to our DNA, and can be used to create things in any degree of complexity.  Keeping in tune with the Burning Man theme of appreciating life and radical self-reliance the Dode Project came to being.  This sculpture stands just over 11' tall and is made entirely out of wood.  It is supported by multiple wooden connectors that keep the structure standing with interlocking joints and tension.  The sole use of wood and connectors that hold the structure together is the visual representation of using what is present in front of you efficiently.",

At night the orbs will glow in changes of color and later glow under black lights.   On the butterflies wings will be one of four phrases: Love Each other  * Help Each other  *  Inspire Each other   *   Forgive Each other\r\nParticipants within and without the community will have been invited to collaborate by making and bringing the butterfly components to be installed in addition to the artist made components.  Other participants will have been invited to take a butterfly, carry it back to their community and on Sept 21 they will install their butterfly within their community or gift it to an individual.",

    "description": "While walking in the desert, a light breeze picks up. Large fish hang from poles, float and oscillate in the wind while a strong and steady presence looms over: a 12 ft wide Manta Ray shades the playa from 10 ft above.\r\n\r\nThe Reef Pass is there for a minute, for an hour, to recharge, exchange and nourish us. Like the manta ray does at the pass, fixing itself in space and time, it replenishes itself as it faces the current. A divider between the worlds of the lagoon and the ocean, the reef pass is where all spirits meet.\r\n\r\nAt night, from the distance, a massive ray floats in mid air, lighting the surrounding area with its glow. The art takes life in an array of color with bright fish swinging in the wind. The spirits are well alive and a symbol of transition between worlds, the Manta guides you through the night.",

UV-reactive glowing tubing wraps around and through the sculpture criss-crossing to create a colorful woven web of lacy geometric dimensional patterns.

Once again, BlinkingMan Camp ('97) will surprise visitors to the deep playa with a little something on the phence - Cameras this year. Each will be adorned with recycled and random items. The cameras themselves do not work - they were heading for a landfill.  Friends adopted some of them and their point of creative view adds to the eclectic \"yard art\" nature of this project. Every camera has a unique theme with a hidden meaning! Perhaps you discover it or you connect your own meaning to enjoy the visit. The deep playa is a gem, the citizens of the city that visit are rewarded with views and sounds many accidentally eschew. Please take a photo with your personal favorite and send it to me. After the event I will include it in a slideshow to be shared with the community. SLRT, where you capture an image of one of Black Rock City's  special places.",

The hole gets bigger as the sculpture hollows from the passionate Fire Inside her! The fire is extinguished before the sculpture looses structure.

In addition to hosting tea parties at sunrise and sunset, we are serving Guatemalan cacao blessed by a chocolate shaman. It's the ultimate heart opener! At the center of this beautiful, organic structure is the Tree of Knowledge, a living, breathing encyclopedia comprised of mind-blowing facts and ideas about the universe crowdsourced from desert dwellers like yourself. The Tree of Knowledge also features an interactive sound installation.",

    "description": "Soul Refuge is a desert mirage.  It appears to be a lone standing wall of an abandoned house that has fallen after a disaster. The house is in rubble. The house up close, is comprised of human souls that make up the mortar and stone. As the house crumbles, these spirits are set free. The piece conveys escape, release and regrowth. It's a visual essay on the theme of entrapment and freedom. As we travel through human life, we are broken down and destroyed.  This loss enables us to re-create ourselves so we can transform into different type of being. The wall is a bright green, patinaed by desert sun, and the figures will blossom out of the firmament to tell their own haunted stories.\r\n\r\nThe house is a place of security which is now lost. It's haunted by the lives that have resided there. As the dwelling crumbles, the freed souls flee into the new haven of the desert which is  its own trap.  This cycle of human life is our constant quest for that one 'Soul Refuge'.  (sole refuge)",

To take something mostly associated with religion and indoor churches, and evolve it into something to be celebrated for everyone who wanders by, while still maintaining the essence of intricacy, self-reflection, and community gathering traditional to the medium. \r\n\t\t\r\nThis evolution also opens up a world of tactile interaction that was previously unaccessible with stained glass windows for fear of shattering and destroying the art. The piece at its core is a delicately-patterned piece of art that can be safely experienced hands-on and visually via distorted reflections from mirror pieces.\r\n\r\nThe structure resembles an archway from certain angles and colorful reflective spokes coming out of the playa from others.",

The peak of the structure reaches 20' tall by 42' wide in diameter.The scale represents the tears people left on earth shed when someone takes their own life.The drop combines with a snowflake, then creating dimensional angels to represent the unique   individuality of each person.The octagon footprint creates a fungshui feeling.A rainbow of stairs surround the center tower, representing the peaks and valleys of life. Inside the portal entry is a chakra of color. Second story window seats can be climbed up on, to look out from a higher view.Music played inside will all be of a vibration of the 432 or 528hz frequency creating a vibrational healing chamber amplified with crystals.",

Spoken words, hand claps, performances on musical instruments, and all other sounds made within the installation are rewarded with a lush, surround-sound response as they are echoed throughout the space by a number of small pillars rising above the playa\u2019s surface, scattered across an area approximately 80 feet in diameter.",

    "description": "An active seed of conversation regarding the inevitably of complexity and challenges of true city-making at BRC. The common decay and resignation to poor quality public facilities in light of privatization of space and access by the \"haves\" to higher quality facilities. In conversations while planning, one of the most common issue discussed is access to private toilets.When in fact, this is completely at odds with Burning Man ideas of a commerce free society. Can BRC better the mundane of cities?\n\nThe installation is a Golden Toilet, filled with playa to the brim, in the center surrounded by a 4' radius circle of mirrors. Openings into this pod are accessed by burners contorting their bodies through a 15' thick field of strapping starting at the edge of a 20' radius. Burners see the toilet, navigate access past no trespassing signs, and then once inside see an infinity of gold, entitlement and themselves in the mirrors. A journal awaits them there. Conversations will be sparked.",

Each piece is conceived as an open-form construction of thin mirror-polished stainless steel.  The concept uses aligned leading edges to delineate facets, while reflectivity implies transparency. Their reciprocal relatedness act to depict volumetric form. The fascinating sculptural trompe l'oeil, thus achieved, implies the structure, and weight of transparent solids. \r\nThis work is conceived as a site for personal reflection; an opening to wonder\u2026 I see it as a kind of paraliminal magic; yes, a trick of the eye, all misdirection and mirrors\u2026 but it engages a deeper, more mystical sense of magic, as it invites personal revelation to de-materialize the perceived object, and encourage reflection on the object\u2019s persistent illusive state.",

So people will have to come together, and support each other getting up and down. The stage like situation invites burners to interact and play with the environment, slip into the role of a child or a lilliput and with their own body, experience a different concept of size. In the presence of the giant table and chairs, the viewer will feel physically diminished and will be returned to the experiences of childhood adventure.\nThe sensation of being thrown off balance by the striking discrepancies in the scale of this setting is an invitation for people to think about  existing structures in the default world",

Our art is the actual substance, the photons of light gathered at that one special moment and preserved. At the exact time of our choosing, light is captured within a unique combination of chemicals, equipment, location, space, and human involvement.\n \nThe experience of creating original art on the playa is a large part of Pinhole Project. Participation is a one-of-a-kind imaginative event.  Just as light is gathered in a unique moment, so too are the contributors. Individuals assemble to be a part of the creative process.

When in motion, it gives us a sensorial illusion that messes up with our labyrinth making each experience personal and unique.\n\nThe objective of the installation is to face the unexpected, its about recreating itself through the presence of each interaction.\n\n\u201cMangueira\u201d challenges us through sensorial illusions where you don\u2019t expect much when you see it, but everything changes when you experience it. Its and individual or collective journey, you are free to chose.",

The base of the tree is an 8ft diameter circle, plasma cut by hand to form the tree's root system.  At the base of the tree trunk sits a children's toy piano which has 25 keys with the bell chimes tuned to the corresponding notes.  The keyboard is midi controlled with wiring that goes through the trunk and limbs that powers a solenoid to strike the bell chime, as well as powers on an LED light rod parallel to the chime that fades as the chime sound fades.  The toy piano has an led strip that illuminates the keys at night.  The base is also backlit by leds which light up when the notes are played.",

Imagine entering the artery at night and seeing what looks like a giant cluster of glowing fish eggs suspended in the darkness. As you come closer you see perched in the rafters above the heads of onlookers and passersby a cluster formed from 50+ individually controllable glowing spheres gently progressing through colorful shades. As the night progresses Touffe evolves into a participant in the festival, bursting with multi color patterns of light, flashing, pulsing . . . dancing to the beats of the music. The possibilities of combinations are limitless. . . a cluster of fish eggs tucked into the ceiling, a parasitic mass pulsing to the music.\nWhen i design a site specific art piece i consider concepts like  topography, climate, etc. Meaning \u201ccluster\u201d in French, Touffe can take on many forms depending on the geography, architecture, local flora, etc.",

The structure will be like a griffin, but instead of the head of an eagle and the body of a lion, the float will have the head of a jester and a body of a travel trailer.\nMade using traditional New Orleans papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 float construction, the float will be constructed using many of the same techniques, materials and by the same artists that carry on the tradition of Mardi Gras as members of New Orlean\u2019s Krewe du Vieux.",

She is intended to challenge the viewer to see past the sexual charge that has developed around the female body which has been used for power and control, to the human being.  We hope to inspire men and women to take action to end violence against women, making room for women's voices, thus allowing both women and men to live fully and thrive.",

    "description": "The giant Kaleidoscope is a re-imagining of the classic childhood toy. Traditionally, a kaleidoscope is a triangular prism, comprised of mirrors with loose beads or pieces of glass held at the end opposite the eye hole.  When rotated, the moving pieces create colourful patterns with an effect that is absolutely mesmerizing.  Our intention is to give the viewer that same feeling of awe, as when they first looked through that tiny eyehole as a child.\n\nThis kaleidoscope has been scaled up to eleven feet long and the colourful beads have been replaced with colourful humans.  The scope manually rotates within a cradle at a height people can easily look through and even climb inside.  Lights around the openings frame the image, accentuating the triangulated pattern and provide a brilliant invitation to explore.  Everyone becomes an integral part of the interactive experience - Voyeurs become participants and the adventurous become part of the world within.",

The intriguing outer walls resemble ornate Chinese folding screens. Once inside Burners will find a mysterious mirrored crystalline sculpture which will reflect their crazy decorated bodies in its multiple facets and encourage spontaneous and uninhibited performances. The tattoo imagery of the intricately laser-cut petal walls is inspired by the magnificent Tattooed Ladies of the early 20th Century Travelling Carnivals. The \u2018skin\u2019 of the Cirque celebrates these Ladies as early pioneers of Radical Self Expression. It reminds us that our bodies are our personal canvas and how we paint, ink, pierce and decorate them, clothe and conceal them, flaunt and expose them, remains our own very personal choice. Elegant mirrored images of contortionists in the lower panels also celebrate the marvels of the human body.",

Simon, as a memory game, is by definition a test of skill and meets the Principle of Radical Inclusion by being easily accessible by its basis as a childrens\u2019 game.  The principles of Interactivity and Immediacy are met by a flame effect game.  That is, the sculpture is animated by Interactivity and rewards the participant with immediate gratification proportional to the interaction, setting up a virtuous cycle.  What the original game lacks, this project delivers: a win-condition with lighting, sound and flame effect display.  Bluntly, we feel that a game of Simon within the \u201cCarnival of Mirrors\u201d theme with a light, sound and flame effect display is a winning combination.",

    "description": "Inflection is a suspension bridge. It goes nowhere, but the goal is the journey, not the destination. It is a hanging challenge with a literal twist; a problem which exists only to be overcome. The traveler will experience an easy ramp, a gentle glide onto the bridge, followed by wicked curves and a pointlessly difficult bend in the middle. The translation across the twist signals a transformation in the challenge, the point at which the journey's end is in sight. Lights adorn the structure and pieces underneath the bridge, allowing for quiet reflection.",

Medieval architects used the arched geometry of ribs and vaulted ceilings to achieve a soaring lightness and elevate the spirit; the architecture had a spiritual function. We have digitized these geometries and manipulated them in parametric models to design a contemporary structure that achieves the same objective.\r\nThe Arbour celebrates life through geometry, which underlies the structure of so many life-forms. The Arbour's soaring ribs draw our gaze heavenwards and inspire us to reach for the stars.",

One imagines what creatures might evolve there in the heat and the dust, with the sun and the wind for power, with a peacock's urges to be admired day and night, with a joy in the solitude and the rough edges of the natural world that spawned them. What life forms might develop as the denizens of the Carnival of Mirrors if their constituent molecules were dust and rust and sunlight? \r\n\r\nAn answer to this question is The Dancing Serpent which will be a 14 foot long sculptural metal serpent constructed as a mobile. Canvas sails hang from the serpent to catch the wind, causing the sculpture to swim gracefully through the air, and propane flames sprout from an array of outlets along its spine and jaws.",

In this chapter the Acolytes, inspired by experience gained in the Agora of Light, leave their brethren and shatter forth, embarking on individual pilgrimages of virtue.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in their lives they were alone in the world. Initial interactions with people were bright with conviction and exaltation, each Acolyte advocating from the pulpit of their chosen virtue. However, they observed those with courage act without honor, justice act without wisdom. Idealism shaken, each wondered \"How can any single virtue be the only light that guides one towards a life worth living?\"\r\n\r\nAfter an eternity of seeing only hope on the horizon, a dark, distant well appears. As each labored step brings them closer to The Well of Darkness the Acolytes begin to recognize their friends, who, just like them are dragging a box heavy with the weight of virtue.",

Traditions of Tantra claim that meditation can clear blockages at each \"chakra\", thus permitting Kundalini to rise up the spine to the crown of the head.\r\n\r\nThis piece is inspired by the vintage arcade cabinet, \"Love Tester\", where a grip is squeezed, causing a stack of rainbow light bulbs to rise, to a level supposedly indicating one's aptitude as a lover. Rather than trying to raise the lights toward Kundalini and enlightenment, participants will try to extinguish the lights, top-down, in an attempt to quell their desires and quieten their mind.",

    "description": "The Tree of Transformation is a 20ft tall interactive musical tree. It takes the form of a twisting steel pipe tree trunk sprouting from a full-size upright piano. Three main limbs branch out to form a canopy and support nine steelpans with a four octave range. When the keys of the piano are pressed, solenoids are actuated to strike the pans in the correct location to play the corresponding note. Because some notes overlap between pans, there are a total of 99 solenoids but only 48 notes, which means that some notes will have multiple pans being struck resulting in a rich, complex sound, much like a steelpan orchestra.\n\nAs you approach the piece at night, you will only see the piano by way of a piano lamp which illuminates the keyboard, and a piano bench which sits in front of the piano inviting you to play. When a note is played, each striker also has a high intensity white led light that flashes, lighting up the branches and pans in a sequence following the notes being played.",

The community can express themselves on write-boards, contribute to the tapestry wall, and watch painters creating collaborative murals all week long. At night the cube takes on new life with spectacular lighting that enhances the drama: wall-washers, spots, strobes, lasers, and psychedelic lights add brilliant color that changes interior rooms and spaces, sending rainbows across the dark Playa landscape and illuminating the art and people around the Cube.",

    "description": "Race against the robot overlord of the Chinese factory floor. Win demonically sexy Taiwanese treats and perils in the betelnut booth.  This is a parody of Foxconn, the Taiwanese-owned manufacturer of iPhones, both villain/hero of our consumer society. The betelnut beauty, unique to Taiwan, is a provocatively dressed woman vending legal stimulants in neon-lit booths on the roadside. Evocative of the carnival peep show, she is also a lightning rod for debate about gendered labor.\n\nFoxCarn lets burners experience both forms of capitalist exploitation. They enter for a chance to outrun the robot overlord through the factory floor obstacle course, performing menial tasks like putting stickers onto goods, assembling tangrams, taking naps. If they win, they can \u201cescape\u201d to the betelnut booth, where they must use their bodies to create desire for the goods they just made. Manufacturing, commerce, consumption, exploitation, and spectacle coalesce into a garish temple to modern consumerist society!",

There are shimmering mirrored columns flanking the fish giving the Burner a panoramic view of the school, but also transforming the playa.  The mirrors compress the surrounding mountains, placing the playa in a different place or time.\r\n\r\nAt night as one gets near to the edge of the school bathed in 'water light' the fish at the edge glow brightly briefly and transmit their excitement to neighboring fish sequentially, giving the illusion of movement within the school.",

The branching head area of the sculpture serves as a playful interactive space where participants can become literal neurotransmitters providing the necessary synaptic activation for the piece to come alive. Lighting elements with proximity awareness sensors responding to the movements of participants as they move through the piece will add an additional element to the piece at nite. The sculpture as a whole emanates a contemplative yet engaging quality. Our hope is to create a safe environment for participants to engage in a playful and intimate experience.",

    "description": "For the Carnival of Mirrors theme, the True Reflections Palace completely re-tinkers your perception of who you are with optically perfect, true reflection mirrors.  They show you not just what you look like, but who you are and how you are as an animated, living human being! Backwards mirrors take all of our vitality away and present a flat and distorted version of ourselves.  The design of the Palace will be using Giant Tinker Toys.  Who knew you could build something big with them?   Inside will be a warm, softly lighted environment that offers a host of interactivity and a truly unique experience \u2013 magical even!  There's a lot of science involved too, you can read some of the posters available. A lot of this makes perfect sense for why it should be so different, and so much better.\r\nPrepare to see something surprising about yourself\u2026you as a real, vibrant, and truly sparkling and happy human being. Or deep and genuine burner, with wisdom in your eyes.  Or whatever is true about you - your true image actually reflects all that information correctly, so you can continue to be true to yourself.  But be aware -  you have to \u201cbe it to see it\u201d.  Don\u2019t just stare at yourself - look in your eyes and interact! Ask questions about who you are, how you are, what\u2019s going on. Look with a friend, eye to eye, smile, then look back as you see the real version of you.  Who is the person that we see, who do we know, who do we love? You may need to get past your initial sense of how unusual it is, and no, you are not as asymmetric as your perception can be telling you.  But then you can see something truly magical\u2026the amazing burner that you really are!\r\nTo really make the point, look back to one of the backwards mirrors in the side panels, and notice how poorly mirrors reflect your true nature. Notice that the sparkle and light in your eyes just stops and you are staring, and more often than not, you become serious and doubtful.",

When the qi field is aligned, the seeker spins the wheel, which stops on the seeker's fortune.\r\n\r\nSometimes the seeker is unable to grok the fortune.

    "description": "Those in search for enlightenment in the dark will step into our tent of mystery to discover three aura meters with two sets of corresponding buttons/switches by their left and right sides. Each meter has an ascending order of color LEDs representing chakra points on the body. Players will compete with others in their race to light up all the chakras, by holding down the correct order of matching buttons, thereby triggering the corresponding chakra lights to turn on. The buttons will have an image/phrase that correlates to the respective chakra meaning, in some way... Some of the buttons might be tricks! We hope to reignite the true search for one\u2019s own elightenment, chakra alignment and openness by guiding players towards their personal discovery, beyond traditional meditation, with satirical stimulation and tickling of their senses.",

    "description": "The King of Fun is meant to be an individual interactive experience tailored to the specific user. Using a pulse sensor the person currently interacting with the piece places their hand on the sensor. While reading their pulse the machine lights up around the King inside to the rhythm of their pulse, making the experience unique to the participant. While reading the pulse the King begins to shake his instrument of fun, a Martini shaker, while he contemplates their fortune. After 30 seconds the King speaks his words of wisdom and the participant is presented with a quest dispensed from lower in the machine that will challenge them to perform a specific task or quest that will send them on their playa journey. We believe that while giving a fortune would tell them WHAT will happen, sending them on a quest sends them somewhere to MAKE something happen. They become participants in the Black Rock City experience rather than spectators.",

The pole come in three heights, with the smallest paddlewheels being mounted on the tallest poles and the largest paddle wheels being mounted on the shortest poles.  This height and size arrangement takes advantage of an old Hollywood move trick called \u201cforced perspective\u201d and gives the illusion of a great deal of height separation.  Burners attending the event occasionally need a place to relax and contemplate.  This sculpture with its gentle overhead motion, and kaleidoscopic dance of light and shadow, will provide Burners with such a place.",

The Dragon Smelter itself is a kinetic piece of sculpture which is made up of 60% recycled materials. It contains a propane-powered reduction furnace for the aluminum melting, has a rotation causable for safely pouring it into sand molds which contain designs by the artist and participants who learn to make casting molds through artist workshops.

    "description": "Inspired by the geometry from the crystalline growth pattern of the element Bismuth, the Bismuth Bivouac is a playful pavilion celebrating the orthogonal geometries that exist in natural Bismuth crystals to form an intriguing cubic structure, with spiralling disruptions on each face, governed by the golden ratio. From a distance, it appears as a solid cube but intricate spaces can be discovered when you get closer. The iridescent colours of crystal translate into the proposal through coloured LED, built into the lumber structure, so at night the pavilion gives the same visually mesmerizing, colourful effect of the crystals in nature.",

    "description": "Scorched, dry, barren, the desert wilderness sits silent, still, soundless, lifeless, only the pale whispers of the delicate fauna can be heard. Whispering, softly a whisper becomes a murmur, gently a murmur becomes a sound before the faintest of echoes can be heard, it begins. At first a drop, motionless. Weeks pass, slowly, a drop becomes a trickle, trickling, creeping, a journey begins, weaving, the trickle meanders. With time it grows, a small stream flows, filling the cracks of the playa. A sapling emerges, twisting and winding it grows high above the ground, encircling itself, entwining itself. A figure of our memories, a myriad of our existence, its infinitude transcends time and like the stream to the tree we breathe life into the playa. A rest for our minds, a shelter for our bodies, a place not only to remember, a place to never forget. The Infinity Tree is symbol of what can never be lost, what will always be found, and what makes us who we are.",

    "description": "The Light Striker Trial of Strength project is primarily inspired by the high striker game, which is most common to the circus sideshow and carnival setting.  The Light Strikers will stand at an imposing but approachable 10 feet tall and will vary in form.  Lighting will be embedded into the forms on hierarchical levels activated through the main track of the striker.  The ball struck by the force of the lever will trigger switches to these lights, so that if the ball is struck to the top of the Light Striker then all the lighting on the form will be activated.\n    The main interactive component is the high striker mechanism.  Attention is focused on the person wielding the hammer, and the blow that lands causes an primal spike of energy which emanates upwards and outwards.  The goal of the Trials is to create a shared space of luminosity and exuberance on the playa. This would create a harmonizing space where and people can share these experiences and also forge new friendships.",

    "description": "You walk through the dust and heat of day, beyond the heart of the city, and from the haze before you emerges a shape that is both plant and place, flower and temple, both open and contained. No fence keeps you out, but one hundred and eight lanterns mark out the space, like a fairy ring in the forest, like the hundred and eight beads of the Buddhist rosary. \n   \nThrough the archway you walk. Up the long, low steps, the muffled sound of your tread meets the familiar clunk of wood; the music of a seaside pier rises from the dust, invoking the sense of some long lost place where water once stretched out to kiss the horizon. Below, the improbable sounds of water and the briefest hints of ocean blue tickle the imagination. From above, eight dragons of fire and steel peer down, watching you, or look out into the distance, waiting.\n    \nAnd again, the thing that is neither quite plant nor place seems to hover at the edge of defining, the green rooftop like a lily pad, the great lotus rising up out of the dried mud and the memory of water, each petal big enough to sleep in, open out from this improbable tree, this pillar of memories.\n     \nInside, past and present blend and dance together. Old rites and new technologies bring fresh form to venerable, ancient practices. There is hidden circuitry here: casting the moon blocks reveals the will of the gods in a panoply of color and light. The breath of dragons explodes outward in answer to prayer. The goddess herself has been known to appear, if the moment is right.\n          \nYou leave the temple, clutching message and map, and the sound of music finds your ears. Drums, gongs and shouting voices emerge from fantastical shapes, finned and spiny, nautilus-headed dancers and demons with a thousand eyes walk out of the dust, beckoning you to join them. You wonder, for a moment, if you are in fact in a desert, or in the memories of an ancient ocean, seeing the dreams of the sea floor dancing past.",

This year, the Temple of Promise welcomes participants through an archway soaring 97 feet overhead. Once inside, the structure curves in on itself, tapering in width and height down to just 7 feet tall. Along the way, alcoves formed by the supporting arches, as well as wooden sculptures reminiscent of stones in a stream, create altars and semi-private spaces for individuals and smaller gatherings. The lines of the curved wooden walls draw the eye inward and create a canvas for written messages and mementos. As the path continues to curve, it opens into the contemplative altar and the heart of the Temple: a grove of three sculpted trees. The branches are initially bare. Participants will write messages on long strips of cloth and attach them to the trees, creating the gentle shade of Weeping Willows, increasing as the week progresses.",

When the lights went down, the carnival awoke. Carnies tantalized and promised, hemmed and hawed. \"Passerby beware, but not over here!\" was the promise. Behind the tents, the seedy and profane were flowing with ease for those that were willing to venture back. As participants approach the Sparkade the first thing they will notice is the Wheel of Misfortune Twister game wheel mounted to the informative and clearly labeled facade. As their eyes dart to the floor, the ominousness Twister pattern overtakes the entire floor space. Upon entering the stall, the participant will be drawn towards either the Self-Serve Selfie Station, Love Machine, Swag Glory Hole, or the Cock Ring Toss.",

This impossibly long hallway lined with overly large childhood games is decorated in a 1920's style. Games like: Simon, Connect 4, Battleship are being played by others consumed with Wonderlust. Exploring this hallway of coalesced time, you feel as if you are getting larger! Space is also compressing! By the time you reach the hallway's end, you are GIANT! There you find a live Zoltar waiting! Searching for an escape, you enter a portal into another dimension ruled by the rich tones of a handmade organ performed by another chrononaut. This calmer world lacks spatial compression, the walls and floor are covered with curves, spirals and fun house mirrors, leaving you with the spins. You try your hand at the keyboard... As if your fingers were possessed, that tune you played as a kid fills the air. Your song ends and you make for the door, now with a sense of Wonderlust!",

We absorb the information in the quantities we are unable to digest, we \"play monkey\", share the information with other people in and out of place not always realizing the meaning of words. \r\nSuch is OraculTang - hairy anthropomorphous eager to have any talk about life, God, love, currency rates but mostly about the conflicts of a modern human, primarily about inner and outer freedom.  \r\nOraculTang is watching the audience acutely with his only eye reacting to their behavior, replying gesture to gesture, word to word. Its cage - covered with mirrors top to bottom - gives the impression of an endless abyss from which our oddish prophet is addressing us. The speech of the monkey first incoherent still reveals age-old wisdom.",

To get into the room participants go through a narrow passage (5x24) that has black clothing strips hanging from the ceiling at all of its length creating a claustrophobic sensation. When a person finally enters the space they see a glowing platform (15x10). \r\nParticipants are greeted by a Krivis (shaman) who leads them to a mirror altar in the center of the platform which comes alive as a musical instrument if you interact with it. The altar allows participants to compose music as easy as Lego pieces: sound loops of basslines, drums, melodies & vocals can be combined in thousands of different variations by placing special controllers on the instrument\u2019s surface.  This includes recordings of Baltic folk artists using traditional instruments, electronics, hip-hop and more.
