# Chat Interface Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. RequestStore Dependency
**Problem**: VectorSearchService was using RequestStore which wasn't configured
**Fix**: Changed to `user_session: nil` in search query logging

### 2. Pool Entity Extraction Timeout
**Problem**: Pool entity extraction was making OpenAI API calls that were timing out or failing
**Fix**: Temporarily disabled pool extraction to get basic chat working

### 3. Streaming Implementation
**Problem**: OpenAI streaming wasn't working due to incorrect proc syntax
**Fix**: Used proper streaming proc: `stream: proc do |chunk, _bytesize|`

### 4. Response Format
**Problem**: Frontend expected SSE format but controller wasn't properly formatting
**Fix**: Ensured all responses use `data: ` prefix and proper JSON encoding

## Working Endpoints

### Simple Test (No OpenAI)
- **URL**: `/chat/simple`
- **API**: `POST /api/v1/simple_chat`
- **Purpose**: Tests basic SSE streaming without OpenAI

### Debug Chat (Basic OpenAI)
- **URL**: N/A (API only)
- **API**: `POST /api/v1/debug_chat`
- **Purpose**: Tests OpenAI streaming without context

### Fixed Chat (Full Implementation)
- **URL**: `/chat` (updated to use fixed endpoint)
- **API**: `POST /api/v1/fixed_chat`
- **Features**:
  - Vector search for context
  - OpenAI streaming with context
  - Proper error handling
  - CORS support

## Test Commands

```bash
# Test simple streaming
curl -X POST http://100.104.170.10:3555/api/v1/simple_chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chat": {"message": "test"}}' -N

# Test OpenAI without context
curl -X POST http://100.104.170.10:3555/api/v1/debug_chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chat": {"message": "Say hello"}}' -N

# Test full chat with Burning Man context
curl -X POST http://100.104.170.10:3555/api/v1/fixed_chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chat": {"message": "What camps have fire performances?"}}' -N
```

## Next Steps

1. **Re-enable Pool Entity Extraction**: Once basic chat is stable, add back pool extraction with proper timeout handling
2. **Add Turbo Streams Support**: Update the Turbo controller with the same fixes
3. **Implement Chat History**: Store and display conversation history
4. **Add Loading States**: Show typing indicators during streaming
5. **Enhance Context Display**: Show which items were used for context

## Architecture Notes

The working implementation:
1. Receives chat message
2. Performs vector search for relevant Burning Man items
3. Builds context prompt with search results
4. Streams OpenAI response with context
5. Handles errors gracefully

Pool entity extraction can be added back later as an enhancement to identify specific concepts in user queries and find related items.
