## OKNOTOK Camp Fixed
OKNOTOK (ID: 1902) now has 6 basic entities:
- location: OKNOTOK
- location: OK Tower
- location: Petaluma
- theme: yin and yang
- theme: edge play
- item_type: art

## Technical Improvements
1. **Structured Outputs**: Successfully implemented OpenAI structured outputs for reliable extraction
2. **Batch Processing**: Leveraged OpenAI Batch API for 50% cost savings
3. **Webhook Integration**: Automated processing via webhooks (with manual fallback)
4. **Entity Normalization**: Consistent entity values across the dataset

## Next Steps
- Monitor remaining ~28 batches as they complete
- Verify Neo4j graph integration
- Test search functionality with newly extracted entities
