Love the theme. My personal trajectory has been interwoven the themes of Burning Man past fifteen years and this one stands out as among the most poignantly resonant. Radical. Ritual. These days, just even contemplating ritual is radical. Rooting for the theme!

Meh. All this spirituality nonsense does nothing for me. I’m sitting out this year’s theme. I wonder if yoga hippy spiritualists understand how incredibly dippy they sound to the rest of us? I have avoided yoga and chakras for my first seven burns, I can avoid this eye-roll inducing babble for my eighth. Next year, let’s have a fun theme.

With all due respect to the comment that the theme is not “fun” and that it’s a bunch of hippie yoga or whatever…Lets get one thing straight, Burning Man is not and should never be viewed as merely a party where every year we are expecting to have a certain amount of “fun”. It’s so much more than a party. It’s a chance to change the world as we know it. Plus if somebody is deciding not to attend based off the theme, that’s pretty whack. The theme is just something that can be used or not used- it doesn’t have to mean anything to you in order to be a citizen of BRC. But cheers to you and that leaves more tickets for others!

There have been years at Burning Man that weren’t fun at all. Years that ripped my soul apart and rebuilt it. Those were the years that were the most important to me and had the greatest impact on my life. I don’t need to go to the desert to party.

All it takes for a fratboy to stay home is to imply some sense of spirit in the theme? That was easy! Thanks for the tip.

I find it amusing that you presume I am a “fratboy” because I do not come to Burning Man for bullshit hippy dippy yoga prayer hands spirituality garbage. Like 60% of the attendees, I am not a religious person. What I am is, in no particular order, an 8-year burner, camp leader, Greeters volunteer, camp MOOP Master, and an art contributor. What I am off-playa is, among many things, a college-educated, home-owner, musician who has sung at Carnegie Hall three times, artist, trouble-maker and community builder. None of these things is Frat Boy. but because I, like 60% of the population of the city return every year not to wallow in some nonsense spirituality, but to make and destroy art – because I *gasp* used the word “fun” I must be some kind of puke-in-your-greywater bucket fratbro? I hope you enjoy your oom chakalaka self-importance. Like the VAST majority of Burners, I am not a fratbro, and like the VAST majority of burners, I am not interested in exploring the tedious and faux-mystical world which arises in the brain of people who take themselves too seriously while doing too many drugs.

I think that ritual doesn’t need to mean religion, or even spirituality at all. My husband and I like to have toasted sandwiches when we’re skiing. Pulling the bread out, heating up the oven, putting the mustard on, putting on two slices of cheese and three slices of chicken– it’s a ritual. It’s soothing and satisfying. If you’ve sung at Carnegie hall, then you probably have a preparation ritual– scales, a certain dinner at a certain time, a glass of water, etc. To me ritual is whatever soothes or invigorates our particular minds.

This seems like one exceptionally long way to say that unique shared experiences create powerful bonds between people.
These epic discourses on trace fence and radical whatever depart from the simplest premis: participate. “No Spectators” was by far the strongest central element of bonding and the great benefit to go to BM. This essential ethos and experiential reference point was set by the roadside years ago.
“God knows why”, Participate Damn It!, is not the first principle, but it’s now smothered in a metaphysics’s tango of lingo.
The one time participant is now on a lofty scaffold observing the masses below. A swirl of words as an observation of what others do, what others feel and of what others have said, is to explain a dance to those that just had the most amazing dance of their own design and energy.
It might be better to just participate in the dance, sweat, sing and swirl….than using the podium for the dissection of the dance with the crude knife of metaphysics.
It can be just a dance.

I actually like your phrase “tango of lingo”. Words, as they evoke experience, can indeed dance. Mind is the penthouse of the soul: come on up sometime, as Mae West said, and see the view. There are many ways to participate, and language is one of them.

I cannot wait to realise your vision for the theme this year Larry. 2016 was my first Burn. I was present for pre-burn and saw the temple build and was amongst the first to enter when it opened. I realised there was much more to the fun and partying – the end is in sight – the identification of the soul and its parts are going to awaken a lot of minds to what we’re here for. Wait – what are we here for? I sighed when the temple burned – because then it was all back to ‘normal’, The return was outrageously difficult. ShamanDome (my home camp) had prepared me for everything but the return.
We’ll be doing some radical rituals at the ShamanDome camp, Shamanic Death Ritual was our most popular, Soul Retrievals and Spirit Journeys. Although I’m also finding my way in all of these – I know there’s something much deeper in the experiences, In the end – it is all so simple.
Super grateful. And very excited to meet you in this dimension. Come and find me.

This is by far one of the best explanations of what Burning Man is and should be. Burning Man is what you want it to be, never what others tell you it is, or should be. Themes, plug and play camps, folks who come to party, folks who don’t participate, none of this has or ever will influence my burn.

It is all moot to me, I cant get a ticket. Last year during Burning man, I went to Kyoto, Japan, where there are over 1,000 temples, unburnt by the bombers during WWIl. They dont burn temples there. I have been to Burning man, the year before, watched the Leary temple burn and the flames dance with each other. I can take it or leave it. If I dont get a ticket this year there are lots of temples in Scotland, Greece, Italy, or Bali. They dont burn them.

For some people, Burningman is the gateway to a sense of community, connection, spirituality, creativity, and sense of “oneness” with all things. If you can get that same sense of wonder and connection through travel to Greece or wherever, then you should do that! Wherever you can find it is just fine.

I think it is telling that this blogpost has virtually no responses when compared to almost any other post made by Larry or anyone. Larry, I am intensely grateful for what you have inspired in my life and the lives of my friends, but wow this is a stinker of an art theme.
Based solely on the 2015 census results, 71.3% of attendees identify as having NO religion, 70.1% report NEVER attending church of any kind, 60% report NEVER engaging in any ritual, a full 48% percent self-identify as atheist, agnostic or “don’t know”, and a mere 5.4% identify as “religious”.
One would have to work pretty hard to come up with an art theme that has less significance to the attendees of Burning Man. But hey, what’s done is done. That’s the theme we’re stuck with. The majority of us will simply walk past the ohm chakalaka nonsense like we do every year. Perhaps next year, we can get an art theme that has some relevance to the vast majority of people who attend. Or maybe next year, Larry will look deep into the Census and declare 2018’s theme “African-American Republicans Who Arrived by Plane “.

I think your analysis is flawed. It may be that, “71.3% of attendees identify as having NO religion, 70.1% report NEVER attending church of any kind, 60% report NEVER engaging in any ritual, a full 48% percent self-identify as atheist, agnostic or don’t know, and a mere 5.4% identify as religious”, but masses of people, whether or not they are participants, are inclined to say they are attached to or looking for some form of spirituality. Like a lot of people, you are mistaking spirituality for religion, as if religious faiths had some sort of trademark on soul and spirit. Furthermore, to state that the majority of people surveyed say they have never engaged in any form of ritual is ridiculous. Have they never celebrated a birthday? Have they never attended a funeral? To tell the whole truth, the majority of artists I know who build temples at the event are de facto atheists or agnostics, but this does not deter them from presenting heartfelt and compelling visions that affect thousands of people.

Chowski says: February 1, 2017 at 4:52 pm
It’s not MY analysis. It is not “ridiculous” to assert that a majority of the people surveyed claim little ties to ritual. That is published fact. That is self-reporting by people who attend Burning Man. In 2015, 60% self-report not engaging in ritual (technically, I think it was 59.9).
What I CAN analyze is that of my campmates, most of whom are 8+year Burners, none of them are talking about this theme. Not one. It has little resonance for us, and is not informing our plans for the year. For a group of people who are significantly less likely than the general population to wallow in “spirituality”, this theme is just not that interesting or inspiring.
I am sure the yoga and prayer-hands-namaste crowd will be delighted by this theme. It just seems, based upon the census facts (not the alternative facts), and the general lack of response to this blog, that this theme is very narrow in appeal to large majority of Burners.
But not every thing has to be for every person. This year, the spiritualists can take the thematic lead, and maybe next year we can have a theme which is inspiring to more Burners.

Agree with Larry here. And Ritual has always been part of Burning Man and Chowski I think you’re just simply misunderstanding of what ritual means for you. You most likely participated in a ritual of sorts at any of your previous burns.
This is a wonderful theme, and NEEDED. Bring back the human rituals that have permeated our existance on this planet. I’m looking forward to seeing all the ceremony and ritual manifest.

This theme is challenging. Definitely not fun. There are probably not a lot of responses because there are other concerns absorbing energy like a black hole. But, I think, Chowski, those of us who like to reside in the “cold and neutral state of intellectual perception” might like to investigate how we use ritual in our lives. Does habit = ritual? Habits reside deep in brain tissue. Obsessive Compulsive behavior is said to be ritualistic. No need to resort solely to Oom chakalaka…..Also, just want to say here I believe we are witnessing the birth of a religion. How cool is that?

My religion includes tolerance, love of the earth, choosing to be happy every day and Burning Man. This will be my 22nd year and I thank you for continuing to host the best party, religious experience and art festival in the world. Everyone has there own take on it and the most asked and unanswered question I get is what is it like? it is different for every person and there is no one way to experience Burning Man. All are correct and nothing is ever the same.

Having read this and other reflecting disappointment about the “ritual” aspect of this theme from veteran burners, I must reflect…
How is an annual pilgrimmage to the desert in August, with its buckets of rebar, dusty fur, and hauling coolers of uneaten food stinking its way back NOT a ritual?? That first shower when you get back and the dirt falls out of your ears, wowwie. It’s better than a birthday.
Pretty damn meaningless from the outside though, if you ask me. Maybe some meta-reflection will help this theme resonate more. Or the meek will inherit the playa this year. Peace and wish you a cool art car next year.

As Larry wrote in his essay intro, I find myself realizing the multiple meanings of ritual — and radical. Specifically I am startled to find how much of the art I make and admire is in fact pysychomagical expression that felt critical to perform. I bet you come to burns with the same feeling. Let us perform these critical, radical rituals together this year, with more multi and marvel than ever.

Society needs to fill the hole left by the erosion of organized faith. Rituals were bringing together groups for millenia on “Sundays” for worship, prayer, exchange about social issues, flirting, drinking, letting the kids learn something in Sunday School. Personal faith – the pinnacle of self-expression and the excuse today for spiritual people shunning organized faith to stop exchange about faith with others – can only cover a part of the positive effect the rituals organized faith provided for society.
Lost me at that point? Google for the background of the “School of Life” of Alain de Botton. THIS will spell out above argument for you.
Burning Man is no religion. Our rituals and gatherings are to us as important as religion is for organized-faith-followers. It keeps us busy bustling with projects.
I think I got the idea. I love it. I expect some useful rituals popping up that will spread through our community – and like peertopeer wifi – spread through the world.

I hate to see Radical Ritual reduced to conversations about faith or religion. Another comment writer referenced Isadora Duncan – ah, yes, genius and movement. Radical ritual for me is making my bed and packing a lunch – took ages to take care of myself in that way. Hiking is up there. Getting up for early early morning Black Rock Desert moments (as opposed to staying up all night), or going naked into water after being parched in playa dust, these are rituals for me. Hugging my friends. Applying my make-up and other ornamentation. Cooking. Radical is in my own way, ritual is with ceremony or practice, or ability to sense meaning in even the smallest of things. Not so much the om shanti shanti thing another person referenced as a celebration of my actually being alive and connecting with others. Circles, dance, flowers, beads, 1960’s Berkeley or the ancient rites at Stonehenge, or washing my face at night before bed. The earth goes round the sun, the moon goes round the earth, the sea returns to shore. Radical. Ritual.

Ritual. An art wholly lost in our modern society. An ancient ritual was an act so profound and meaningful, it was celebrated and benchmarked by the entire community. A boys’ first hunted goat, which would feed his family, evoked a ritual of celebration, a tattoo or a woven blanket was a reward. A girls first period, celebrated for her ability to give life, a moon so bright you could plant seeds by it, giving food. Death, marriage, circumcision. These where at one time accompanied by sacred rituals of vast importance. Those scared rituals of life demarcation and notority are no longer part of our society. It is such a lost art to even name a ritual in our life, one that we honor over and over with humble scaredness. If it bothers you that your BM annual party could be associated with a concept so foreign, then Try very hard to imagine your life now with at least one life celebration of such deep meaning that it defines your remaining years. Then you may find ritual in the simple, the scared and sublime.

My father enlisted in the Navy as an 18 year old. World War II. He served on the USS Silversides, a submarine. One of our favorite stories was of a sailor, whose job was to bring a cup of Java to the captain. This required climbing a ladder. The sailor would take a gulp of coffee, climb the ladder and spit the coffee back, into the mug. The story delighted us kids. My ritual: climb down my ladder, make coffee, and climb back, so I can have “coffee in bed”. I never miss CIB. I am planning to gift CIB 2017. I hope I can share my ritual with you, with a coffee. BYOS. Bring your own spirits.

“Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenace ”
Book by Robert M. Pirsig
It’s the experience of here and now that allow you to evolve . Everything in your life can become a ritual, you don’t have to be religious to reach the your own enlightenment . You can just love what you do and do it with such a passion that every single step of your journey will allow you to get the answers you seek. Humans have always accomplished their higher goals through rituals allowing them to discover who they really are .
It’s a glourious theme full of possibilities. There are a lot to ponder and to create. Radical Ritual does not lie in the answer it gives, but in the questions it raises and the way it raises them .

I was gonna try to stay off-playa this year, but… the theme is so perfect. It’s great to read Larry’s thoughts on the matter, too. Ritual is everywhere, incidentally: when you tie your shoe or make your bed, you are repeating an action. Add a little glimmer of intention to the action, and you may find that meaning erupts from its repetition.
Not to say we should confine ourselves to the shoe-tying sort of ritual. Let us burn men. Let us drown rats. Let us tear down temples with our teeth and eat libraries page by page, panting, sweating, and laughing.

Larry is one of my all time favorite writers and this year’s theme bangs it!
I began calling my “Fire Inside” burns performances but as we developed this new art form I realized it’s not about me, just like Larry said, it’s about everyone there. Over the years we naturally sort of fell on “ritual ceremony” instead, but with out the aggrandizing outfit…just a dusty ol’ Fire Mister here with a chainsaw habit.
Yep, been carving big ol’ monuments here in the High Sierras with a chainsaw since before I could squirt. That’s until I ran into the fun house in my desert. The damn thing twisted my whole life around and soon I was having frightening urges to burn up my cherished “masterworks” — the ones that go for tens of thousands, yikes! But how does one start, essentially a whole log on fire — and then all that mess!
Now I was raised in the forest, got sap in my veins, so I knew that tree stumps can stay burning inside after a forest fire is out, sometimes for weeks — it’s a problem. So I whispered to the wood and listened to my burner friends and together we figured out how create Fire Inside the massive works. (That was easy, I’m still learning how to control the burn.) and it wasn’t long till we began noticing some other-worldly effects.
I swear to my idols, when a whole tree gives up it’s essence, still assembled in its original form it whispers back! Right into the ears of all who are there….
Watch for us in front of the Temple burning a 30′ man enveloped in carved flames, arms up, carved out of a twin tree stump, standing roots up. (If we can raise the money, click my name and see how you or your group could own it. Click “Fundiversify” there.) Come join our ritual, I’ll be the scruffy big guy with a beard and a wild look in my eyes from all the mind-cracking stuff people say to me and to one another. Everyone’s suddenly a guru! I mean it’s some kinda metaphysical force of nature.
Which brings us to rain. We were asked, by a Tahoe Resort to burn holes in one of my monuments, right on the beach. It was billed as a “Pray for Snow Burn” in the previous week’s paper so I thought I’d really try to bring snow.
It’s Friday the 13th, the mood goes intensely introspective when someone interrupts the ceremony with news of the Paris attacks that same day. The Fire Mister recites aloud a poem he’d written about a vote between Order and Anarchy, one he calls “The Choice”. The fire cracks loudly, the release is palpable when suddenly a damn gunman stumbles onto the beach demanding wallets, a warning shot fires skyward! No lie!! It seems like only minutes when a freaking swat team stomps in, all in formation, all in black, M16’s towards the sky. They take chase, apprehending the gunman out on the street — what a night!
Strange occurrences for a peaceful little ritual, but stranger still, as I pack up the last of my burn tools, alone there on the beach, everyone has left when what do I feel — what? Wait for it … snow flakes falling lightly from he November sky.
By morning the fist snow of the season stood four inches, as documented in the paper. Crazily, that storm ended a 12 year, debilitating drought. It snowed all last winter and all this winter too … jus say’n.
Yep, Larry you’re on to something with this Radical Ritual gig … I’ll be there.

Thanks for this Larry,
I remember clearly the Free Bird temple burn incident. In fact that night, somehow synchronicity had me walking directly into the Free Bird fight. That was confirmation for me, and it changed so much about my future. I was sitting with a small group. We were waiting for the temple burn to start, when the shushing began. I was horrified, we were enjoying each others company and sitting and talking. Then my trigger became bigger when a “choral” of what seemed to me churchy singers singing churchy songs went by on a two story bus. The shushing became almost violent at anyone who was talking. The group I was with was not with me on this perspective but having a “be appropriate” posture, giving in to the most demanding rank. Not my things AT ALL -EVER! I got up and took off saying “I come to burning man to get away from this shit!”. On my angry walk out of the mass of shushing bodies I heard Free Bird and it’s song came as a great relief and lifted my spirit. I knew I needed to be with “them”. Whoever they were. As I approached, the infamous fight broke out with the DPW truck soon pulling away in desperation. I couldn’t believe it. I walked away from it all too. That was the last Temple Burn up close for me…

The Holy Spirit and Soul live and breathe within every one of us. In fact, they are what unite us when we argue amongst ourselves about whose ideology beats out someone else’s.
Let us never forget why we are able to get out to the desert in the first place, and experience something that nearly the entire rest of the world will never be able to do:
Spirit has graced us with the ability to freely, creatively, express ourselves. Let us maintain our higher vision and purpose for humanity as we do just this.
