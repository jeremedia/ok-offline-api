Commerce & Community: Distilling philosophy from a cup of coffee …”

This is great article! I believe that nowadays many people who attend burning man simply don’t have the time to read articles like this, otherwise they would much more understand which values are lying behind the whole event.
Muchos gracias for explaining this a bit more in depth! From what I can see, you have so humble values despite of the event growing and growing. Let’s hope we will manage to teach these values all new participators and visitors out there. Otherwise, the event itself will one day end up beeing really mainstream. Not because the values where throwed away, but because all new arrivals don’t take the time to really indulge in what is behind and underneath.

Well said! I think of the burning man event as an island in the sea of the default world. I have to pass through the default world to get to it.
Applying burning man value in the default world can sometimes be a challenge for me. Dealing with closed minded opportunist is a particularly difficult for me but I have the advantage of living in an area of the world with a lot of other “burners” and it never ceases to amaze me as soon as I mention I am a burner to another burner we connect.
I am also not a big fan center camp. I get my coffee from my neighbors or supply it to them which always ends in some interesting conversation. If people want or need to buy coffee they are missing out. Limiting the exchange of money to coffee and ice is, in my humble opinion, no big deal I imagine a world where all you can buy is coffee and ice everything else is gifted. Keep up the good work Larry you rock!

What most people aren’t aware of about the Center
Camp Cafe is that Burning Man actually loses
money each year. They are always in the red when all
is said and done.

How can u lose money? With volunteer workers? This statement is either bullshit or the proof of a horrible mismanaged operation. Show me the books if this is true and I will use the paper to wipe my tears of compassion away from my weathered face.

The huge amount is spent not on the coffee supplies, but the lumber and skilled labor for the Cafe itself. I believe. Check the Afterburn report yourself.

You said:
“Eventually, I came to feel that every great city should provide these kinds of spaces where communal and civic life blend.”
I completely agree. But this is actually one of the things Black Rock City is best at! Front yards are interactive, playful spaces. Even the most residential streets are dotted with alcoves, art, invitations. I don’t see why the center camp has to play that role also…

After going to Burns with a lovely Coffee Place: Steaming Pot. They gift the Coffee up to 3k people a year. I don’t see how having anything that is not Gifting to be allowed when I know the expense several different camps go through a year to feed and gift other Burners. Thus they may lose money but I feel it’s devaluing the ones that take no Monetary donations and/or payment to be at any Burn. If Burning Man has always been about a Gifting Society; I believe it should remain as so.

Hey now! That was a most excellent structure this year, you guys.. I enjoyed it throughly, hanging out underneath it and around it. Many good times were had and stories told. Looking forward to this years anticipation which some times, at times rivales with the experience itself. This year I really want to shift the thoughts of those who make ‘compound spaces’ out or RV’s. Creating dead spots and fields of ‘lack luster’ on the backstreets, frontstreets and sidestreets with their unparticipitory (without participation) ways. If I were a family member in the ‘soccer game’ scenerio and choose to set up a blockade in any section of the playing field. I’m sure I’d have a good part slowing down the game. Turns those fuckers around and come out and show us what your made of. Commit to ‘giving/parcipitating’ and it will fall into place. We want to see you! When you own the world! Your always home!

One thing that coffee houses and cafes have that center camp has few of is tables with chairs around it. There are the sofas facing the stage, the benches and the high narrow tables, and a few coffee tables, but not regular tables people can sit and relax around. I don’t think the current setup encourages socialization as much as it could. A group of people sitting around a table might. When it gets crowded, people looking for a free seat will join strangers at a table.

This always keeps coming up, as one who always had an compound space out of RV’s
These are set up for a private space. Besides having a job on playa and being part of a major theme camp, I put enough out there so stay out of my camp unless invited in. Even frist camp has its private area.

Thank you Larry for your in depth blog.
I’ve been coming to Burning Man from Scotland since ’07 and I have always loved getting a Chia at Centre Camp… however I don’t recall ever having got into conversation with anyone else except a few words with folk in the line and maybe a laugh with the servers.
To me Centre Camp inhibits rather than promotes social interaction as we devolve into the normal rules of default society in a cafe where we talk to our friends only, the server maybe and ignore all others.
I agree with fw that tables and chairs would aid this interaction immensely.
As a contrasting ‘social space’ the art gallery dome this year at 2 0’clock found me in conversation with lots of folk on many different occasions and no coffee was required. :-)
How about ditching the BM Coffee provision at Centre Camp and opening the space up to the community to serve what they want to serve to each other? I would expect it would be used by first timers and those who can’t gift something huge to gift there often… I for one, who hands out chocolate on the playa, would be drawn do so at Centre Camp… interestingly I have never thought to do so nor wanted to do so at Centre Camp and this is because the energy there just seems so closed compared to the rest of the playa.
Blessings to you as we all evolve our hearts and minds. X

Larry: With all due respect (and much IS certainly due to you for starting all of this!) SURELY with all the interesting souls in ever-burgeoning attendance, we can think of a more creative “prop” than simply resorting to default world’s method of exchanging artless mass-produced slips of dirty paper for material goods? Without wanting to join the ranks of the snarky pedants, this nearly-advertised exception to two of our guiding principles (Decommodification as well as Gifting, which are symbiotic) in such a central public place feels like a bit of a barb in the side of these core principles that define our society, and though minor, could appear a bit hypocritical to the outsider looking in. Selling or charging for anything at BM is like dancing soft shoe on a very slippery slope…SO, after a little thought, here are my suggestions on “alternative attractants” (other than those that exist in every nook and cranny of this fantastic city outside of center camp or ice vendors, free of charge):
This last burn I only popped into Center Camp for only a few brief visits. Not having brought any money with me (one of my favorite things about finally entering BRC is that tremendous relief of NOT using or having to think about money in any way!) what did I do there? I browsed the various drawings and paintings on display, and used some of the machines (that mirror device where two people look from either side and their faces morph into one always gets me!)with friends. Most notably, there was a giant gumball machine which dispensed huge jawbreakers which turned to gum. I thought this was genius! Cheaper to distribute and less wasteful than a cup of coffee, right? Also great was the “lost and found,” –equal parts disgusting and intriguing,– but a fantastic participatory conversation starter in any case! Why not have a bigger one? (a tree with hooks instead of dusty cubbies perhaps? Way more “in your face.”) I’m thinking that just adding more of these type of small, intimate participatory perceptual or sensual traps (alla on the observation deck of The Man) might be just the ticket, but with only needing to spend one’s time there…Make the cheese things we all like,–we all like free, right?
What I found a bit distasteful about Center Camp this year was the vibe…Very chaotic and more mainstream than any other place I set a dusty foot in. For me, Center Camp is what I like to refer to as, “A bit like a cool train station, only with no trains,” this year it felt like too much of a traditional performance space, where instead of being mostly interactive or encouraging participation, it was more of your traditional concert venue setup…Lot’s of people standing around listening to a band, speaker, or single performer in way too much relative silence as they sipped their 5$ lattes. I saw WAY too many film crews and cameras there (as well as everywhere this year) for my taste as well! (“No flash photography, PLEEASE!”) I found the whole HOLYWOOD aspect was extremely distasteful, as it wreaked of the all elitism of mainstream society. Anyone with me here? Is this such a good direction to go in, or really the image we Burners want for the most public center of our city? It is my feeling that every open space in BRC should be a free public play-space, at least as much as possible. Even in a performance-venue sense, perhaps having more open mics (I’m sure there are some) or more of an open-jam, rotating musicians kind of setup might encourage more interaction and less division and silence between performer and listener. How about a tarp in the center with a huge board for all to paint, write, or add their marks on? To be burned at the end, of course! Though messy, I am certain this would spark more conversations, laugher, and connections than waiting in line to spend $5 on a cup of coffee. We can all do that in the default world, no?
OK OK OK…climbing down off my soapbox now…Some food for thought…

Without delving into my personal feelings too deeply, I would simply observe that commerce in Center Camp is a point of perennial debate, and has been for a very long time. The fact that it continues to generate such elaborate explanations and defense is worth noting.

If I may, I would remind all that although Burning Man is intended as an oasis of community in the midst of the ‘default’ world, it still must be constructed within that greater world. The sale of coffee, like the sale of tickets, creates the framework for the community to exist. To suppose that the framework could exist otherwise is to ignore reality. Around the turn of the last century, utopian societies created enclaves that were intended to function much as Burning Man City. Nearly all of them failed because, as one commentator put it, “no one wanted to take out the trash”. Burning Man exists for the many because a relatively few dedicated individuals are dedicated to creating the space within the larger world to which participants can temporarily retreat. Use a community theater production as an example. To produce a play, tickets must be sold to pay for the parts of a production that can only be gotten through interaction with the commercial world but the actors, being volunteers, are on the stage because they are in love with the craft. Larry and the others behind this annual event and its regional offshoots are not in it for the money, but because they love the idea. Let me give a final thought. Let those for whom the selling of coffee jars and jangles against the Burning Man ideals be comforted in the beautiful, raucous discussion that ensues in forums such as this.

The Joy Of Gifting Caffeine
Our camp takes a large catering-style coffee urn each year and make ~50 cups of coffee (often w/pancakes) most mornings until it gets too hot.
We have a table “out front” on the street and simply shout COFFFFFFFEEEEE!! at regular intervals. Neighbors and passers-by (in various states of mind and un/dress) stroll up and help themselves. The only rule is that a participant must in turn shout “COFFEE!” at other passers-by.
Sometimes we like to claim the urn contains illicit substances “GIT YER MUSHROOM COFFEE!!!” or even “CUTTLEFISH STEW! ..Tastes just like coffee!”
It’s exceedingly sociable; every year we have fascinating and hilarious conversations with an entirely random selection of folks.
It’s inexpensive and easy to provide – but _most_ of all it ensures my day starts with Greeting, Gifting and Participating and that’s really the greatest joy of all.
There will always be center camp for coffee but I highly recommend doing it yourself as well. :-)

john ian marshall you are being too nice, it’s not a cool train station with no trains, its more like a bus station , a crappy anonymous place where people are allowed to be. But isn’t that what all of Burningman is supposed to be? There is no reason to sell coffee except that the world is full of junkies and coffee is legal. I don’t carry money, there is no use for it. It’s ridiculous to make an exception to the ” no vending” rule for coffee. Ice sales are closer to a public health service but hell let’s drop those as well. What you can’t make it camping without ice, well then choose another event to bespoil.

I can’t help but notice that nearly all of these focus on the operation of our café in Center Camp. There’s nothing wrong with this—all discussion on this topic is entirely welcome. But, I’d hoped to provoke a deeper discussion about the interrelation of commerce and community in the greater world—the one that all of us inhabit in our daily lives. This is why I inserted the extended passage authored by Zay Thompson, but thus far no one has directly referred to it.
I suppose this is only natural, since the café, along with the porta-potties, loom large in everyone’s experience at the event. I also think this is amplified by a tendency to regard Black Rock City as a place that is purely and profoundly set apart from the values of what many call the ‘default’ world, and in several ways, I to this vision. And yet, this strenuous point of view can also become cripplingly rigid. It is as if a line were being drawn between a world that represents all that is higher and good, and another that stands in for all that is fallen and bad—an almost metaphysical struggle between forces light and darkness. Hence, the commonly expressed fear that any perceived backsliding will instantly create a slippery slope, a greased chute, that leads to straight to perdition, as in a sermon by Cotton Mather.
This is why I recommend the much gentler discourse provided to us by Zay Thompson. Among the many striking insights that he provides, he suggests that there exists a kind of “peripheral zone” in which the values that characterize commerce, and the values that are native to community and culture, can be made to more than merely coincide—that they can actually reinforce one another. In fact, he goes even further than this: he theorizes that if one value system simply subordinates the other to its aims, then both will take corruption and the whole will fail—and this is a profoundly moral vision. I believe that we must join together, if Burning Man is to achieve great and lasting relevance in the world, in exploring this question. It is not enough for us to feel that we are redeemed souls, washed clean of all sin by virtue of a one-week retreat in the desert. Free thought and discussion, mixed with a little old-fashioned trial and error, surely can’t harm us. Let’s put our values to the test, not see them as a refuge in a naughty world.

Thank you for such carefully thought out and illuminating way in which you’ve “peripherally” bridged commerce and community, and their practical interplay, Larry. I must say, upon reading your article once, I was left pondering the seeming hypocrisy in which the principle of gifting was alive in the “non-default” world. However, allowing myself to take the message in and have it penetrate the outer layers of my reasoning and land on more real, raw layers of my human nature, a beautiful metaphor emerged:
In an attempt to “fly”, break away from what IS (i.e. from “default” world into the playa realm), keeping grounded in what IS is a necessary condition for the system not to explode, for equation to not get out of bounds, mathematically speaking. While there is something in us, humans, that operates on a “transactional” level, negating it completely leaves us with no basis on which to transform it or expand naturally out of it. Perhaps that is why more first-time Burners might find greater comfort in having a familiar thread to launch themselves off of.
If nothing else, this might be a great example of Radical Inclusion of contradictory ways of being. Perfectly fitting with Burning Man, in my examination.
Yes, people read this post years after it has been published.

So it seems we might be focusing on different parts of the conversation. Larry, you want to explore the values of community and commerce and how they might be integrated. Zak provides a framework for doing this—and I think it’s a good one. Burning Man (the movement, not the event) wants to push new paradigms and ideas. The interaction of commerce and community is certainly among the most powerful and important balancing acts to master in a world increasingly tilted toward commerce and away from what it means to be human. Bravo for going deep into the DNA or OS (depending on your metaphor) of the human experience. The movement wants to spread beyond the Playa.
Many of the here take the departure point as Burning Man (the event itself, not the movement) is entirely a sacred ritual. One that in order to work, must be treated without “experimentation” and must hold to its stated ideological values. For those focused on the event (rather than the movement), sales of any kind feel like an intrusion from a default world that once a year, they get to escape entirely. For one shining week a year, we can fully and completely unplug from the default world. And that is our work. To see how fully unplugged we can become. The Burning Man event is a real-time psychological experiment with how “other” we can become during the week. When we see others who are still buying and selling it undermines the entire premise of a gifting, giving based possibility and makes it more difficult for us to fully explore the created, non-default way of being. It’s like people talking on a cellphone during Zazen or Mass. Even if we are able to resist electronic devices ourselves, others are on their devices jacking into the default way of being and it can be very distracting for those who are new or shaky or looking to go deep into a new way of being.
I think understanding what we come to Burning Man (both the event and the movement) for is the key to understanding each other. I get the Larry and the leaders may want to use the event for more than just ritual. Education, exploration, and experimentation of how to “take it back” to the real world (particularly after coming to how many Burns?) Yet the newbies and the pure of heart are not yet interested in this expansion—at least not during the event.
Specifically to the coffee thing: if you’re interested in testing the movement and trying to push it beyond the playa, certainly there are more interesting, effective, and less ideologically offensive ways to do this. The Burning Man Blog being one of them. For example, in reading the posts and writing this, I’ve already shifted my own understanding of how to engage “that thing in the desert.” TEDx is another way to expand beyond the Playa. My position, ditch the café since it doesn’t do what it purports to and cook up another experiment—one that really will push folks who have come to the desert to take it back and change their worlds. Now I must go get some coffee.

contradiction is inevitable and beautiful.
i love it that nothing is for sale at burning man, except the two things are for sale.
exceptions are great.
but more dangerous is demanding 100% purity.
or 100% allegiance
down that road is extremist fundamentalism.
i truly love and accept thou shalt not kill.
except when i have a sore throat and gargle with salt water and kill bacteria by the thousands.

Respectfully, I’d like to roll down memory lane. In 1998, there was a center stage, rather than a cafe, in center camp. Live musical acts played wild music, and a small number of port-o-potties behind the stage filled to over-flowing, alongside a few moop-spilling garbage cans. Much as I loved the music, the smell was less desirable, but it was my first year & even excrement grows rosy in the air of nostalgia.
I’ve always loved cafes, and Center Camp Cafe is a sentimental favorite now: best art & music, poetry & contact juggling, and the ever shifting masses come to escape the cold or the wind before changing off to parts unknowable. It’s easy to become part of the scenery there, to make one’s self an accent piece like the couch pillows, which comfortably transitions former strangers into new friends. But memories are delicate things, prone to distortion & to delusion over time. The evolving art of center camp always impresses; why not evolve coffee sales as well? I can honestly say I have only gotten free coffee once in all my years of continuous attendance since 98- it was an act of kindness from the cafe staff, which I hesitate to bring up at all (personally, I prefer my act of charity to be nameless & quiet, letting the act speak for itself).
Why not free coffee? We, the participants, can do that- have you ever paid a bridge toll for the car behind you? Would work in Center Cafe, particularly in you run short on gifting ideas initially. Does charging people for a cup need to be tried? Coffee is cheap; why not give some away to those with cups? Having read through this list of responses, I may have neglected to see anyone from Cafe Camp respond: how would do they feel the center can best suit the shifting face of BRC?
Sorry to run so long; my fondness for Center Camp Cafe is painted over with new memories each year. Decommodification starts at the Event & echoes outwards for a great many newbies, and even reminds us old dust bunnies to gift ourselves some humility too. We’re Burners- want it changed? Make it happen. wouldn’t hurt to demonstrate that Idea right in the heart of BRC.

The 10 principal blog should tell the world about Burning Man through Our experience with it! I have already Heard Larry’s and crew, I want to hear what the 99% think of the Burning Man 10 Principals? At least that’s what I thought this was?… Not a bashing of others experiences, but what you got out of the culture.
This inspired me:
”We came to Burning Man because we saw something was happening—we felt its potential all the way down to our bones, sometimes from the other side of the earth—and we were called to be a part of it. Later, maybe, we learned it has 10 Principles, and we started looking to them as a way to aspire to what we were already inspired by.” ~Caveat Magister
I heard about Burning Man in Alaska in 2000, and made the treck in 2003, out to the Black Rock Desert. Changed my Life forever! A lesson in Manifestation, Letting Go, Moving Forward and Creating. I did find the 10 principals soon after… and I wanted to aspire to what Burning Man inspired… I think this is through education of what Burning Man is to US, and not the perception of the media, law, or corporate greed. The Philosophical Center is a place now where you can share your Burning Man experience… I thought? Again, The 10 principal blog should tell the world about Burning Man through Our experience with it! What’s the 99% think of the Burning Man 10 Principals?

in 2009 my girlfriend and I attended Burning man for the first time, the experience was overwhelming for her at first. Center camp was very helpful. we meet a lot of people there, we always intended to drink a coffee and get on our bikes and ride out to see and do and meet, and often found we had to think, wow we have been hanging out here for the longest time. Center camp and coffee sales worked perfectly for us, just the way I now know it was intended.
If you do not want to buy coffee at burning man, don’t buy coffee. Maybe though you should consider why it upsets you so much that I do? I will try to keep my money in my pocket until the last second, and slide it discreetly across the counter like I and buying a dirty magazine so as not to offend, seriously I will because I don’t want to interfere with your illusion, as I am sure you do not want to interfere with mine.
Besides who wants to face the day without a good cup a coffee and an exchange of smiles and thank you, is the money really that big of a deal?

Soooo much I could say. After reading the blog and responses….I will endeavour to step out of my comfort zone and not rely on tables or chairs to create an excuse to be near and interact with people Disscussion of centre camp has prompted a thought process in relation to what I feel I may need to interact. I’m taking that element onboard.

I’m a little concerned with services like this popping up: http://playabikerepair.com/products/burning-man-bike-rental
Bike rentals? this seems so wrong. Is there some sort of new leniency going on here? Selling something on the playa to say it support the camp is just insane. Center camp is kinda ok since it’s sort still a controlled market… setting up shop though… The good thing about Burning Man is that if this one gets fucked up from crap like this we can always start another one in the founding principles behind this one. Would Love to see if anyone from Bmorg reads this and possibly address the bike rental issue. Mayb it’s not on the radar yet? I’m getting sponsored FB feeds from them meaning that like a good business they are spending money advertising.

It would seem to me that the cafe is not just a meeting place, but a place of refuge, a destination, a cozy haven complete with people happy to have a warm comforting beverage in their hands, surrounded by other comforted souls close by. At least this is how I feel in the early a.m. with no gifted caffeine close by. Though the art installations are amazing and the space inviting it would not draw me day after day without the allure of the drink. The addicted know what I am saying. I can see the truth in a commerce free cafe but shudder at the throngs of the coffee addicted stumbling and lurching around without the daily fix. Caffeine, I am afraid to say, could not be supplied in the quantity’s needed from a gifted society. I have tried, it is hopeless. On the other hand, with the monies generating the funding for the structure and the crews who return year after year to build it, their wages, and support for the weeks and weeks they are there, I am in favor of it. It frees up more capital for the amazing fireworks display which puts many towns displays to shame. Or more porta potty cleanings and road work. Art grants, And even monies to the Gerlach school district. All this happiness in a cup that costs around the same as a latte in Portland,or Seattle or Walla Walla. Just think how good a free cup o’ joe would taste. Medically speaking it would get the job done but would not be too satisfying I think. But organic, micro roasted, expertly made desert elixir, crafted on real f’n espresso machines by real f’n baristas in the middle of nowhere! Happy to pay for that small patch of normalcy in the pothole infested altered crazy universe that we call home. At least I can be in command of one small thing, and especially around Thursday when it all closes in.

Hi, my name is Melvin, I’m from Louisville. I have been trading on the Internet for a long time – I have my own online pharmacy of high-quality ED drugs. I offer you my services and a large catalog of generics, as well as original pills, such as Viagra, Cialis, Levitra.
Buying from an online pharmacy is profitable. Firstly, I do not set a large margin on drugs, because I directly cooperate with most manufacturers. Secondly, I save your time: you do not go to ordinary pharmacies and are not looking for a doctor’s prescription. Thirdly, I guarantee the quality.
Buying ED drugs is a great opportunity to solve potency problems. Try it!

I really appreciate your smart writing as the design of your blog.
Is it a payment issue, or have you treated yourself?
In any case, the best thing about writing remains, it is rare to see such a beautiful web page like this one day.

I am shy and quiet in public, but in the bedroom, I am very sensual and open-minded. I like to take my time exploring a man’s body with soft touches and kisses all over and make him want me so badly he can’t wait any longer to have me. As an upscale companion I am highly professional and 100% discrete. I can’t wait to meet you

Whenever this was framed, a couple of years after the fact it was concluded that all boilers ought to possibly be fitted by Corgi enrolled installers while charging for an establishment.

I recently was at a regional Burning Man event where there was a booth set up to solicit funds for one side in a mid east conflict. Acknowledging that a good artpiece can be disturbing, and I wonder how this fits into the concept of decommodification?

“Commerce & Community: Distilling philosophy from a cup of coffee” reflects the artistry behind both coffee brewing and crafting film jackets. Just as coffee brings people together to share ideas, well-designed film jackets tell stories and evoke emotions, enhancing the connection between the audience and the cinematic experience.
