theme. It was an adaption of The Inferno, Dante Alighieri’s masterpiece, and it came to be known as the Helco theme. I’d learned quite early on that it was possible to tell a story on the playa by siting artworks on an axis. As participants proceed along a path, their progress can be turned into a scenic narrative. In this instance, the story was about an attempt by Helco, a supra-national conglomerate, to take over Black Rock City. It substituted corporate-induced consumerism for metaphysical evil, and I thought that this subversive farce was a success; it was very funny, it spawned much collaboration, and nobody was hurt—Kal Spelletich created Cerberus, the fire breathing three-headed hound of Hell, Pepe Ozan staged the City of Dis, and Flynn Mauthe built the famous Helco Tower.
In designating Helco as a common enemy, I’d hoped to somehow sublimate our conflicts, but this didn’t mend our deep political divisions. Some key players ceased to speak to each other, relationships unraveled, and within our little group, events propelled us toward a crisis. Even as I worked with artists to produce a coordinated art theme, a T-shirt circulated in the underground; it read, “Burning Man: Woodstock or Altamont? You be the judge.” Many seemed to yearn for an apocalyptic confrontation. I still remember lines I wrote to introduce the theme, “Throughout successive ages Hell has been a place of banishment. Whatever we wish to cast out of our world or out of ourselves is here destined to reappear and confront us. Unlike Heaven, the home of the perfect, Hell is, and will always be, a supremely ironic place.”
Out in the desert, before Burning Man officially opened, a motorcyclist collided with a van. It happened on a playa track that led to Black Rock City. When I arrived at the scene of the accident, I was told that the cyclist had been playing chicken with the larger vehicle, and that he had died upon impact. The victim was a daredevil who had been heard to say, “I heard someone’s going to die out there this year.” I didn’t know him, but many people in the underground did, and it shocked them profoundly. After talking to the police and the people involved in the accident, I said, “There’s no blood on our hands.” —meaning there was nothing that we could have done to prevent it; it was purely the result of reckless personal behavior. But the remark was like a lighted match dropped into tinder. Taken up and repeated, it ignited a wildfire of recrimination. In certain circles, this was considered to be proof that I cared only about liability.

I spent a significant amount of time that year in Center Camp. Often I would catch myself gazing up at the lampposts stationed there; their presence helped define the place. I had designed these spires in 1994. They are slender, well proportioned, and evoke a sense of grandeur; their purpose is to mark our public space. Even after the Man is gone, the Temple has disappeared, and all of our participants have returned to their homes, these landmarks linger on—the span of spires leading to the Man is one of the last things disassembled, like the remnant of some lost civilization. In a very real and immediate way, these lampposts signify the presence of a higher civic order. And I vividly remember what I saw one night, while watching people move among them. Participants walking bikes would actually apologize when blocking the way of pedestrians. Many people stopped to talk with strangers. Everyone, it seemed to me, was well behaved, as if each person felt they shared a greater home. After I went to bed that night, just before I drifted off to sleep, I remember thinking, “The center is holding.”
I awoke the next morning to the sound of someone pounding on my trailer door. An accident had occurred about two miles from the center of our city—this was in an area we’d set aside for rave music. I had talked with the organizer before the event. He was earnest and idealistic, and proposed that music groups would form a giant circle, in emulation of our Center Camp. This arrangement, he told me, would allow them to broadcast amplified music without interfering with one another He said that he and his girlfriend would organize a communal area at the center. Early on, I cycled out to check-up on their progress. Camped at the center of this great circle, they’d created a small garden golf course, and were setting up a breakfast nook. When I returned a couple days later, however, they were nowhere to be found. Not only had the rave camps failed to interact with one another, no one had paid any attention to the community-gathering place. After a night in which cars had hurtled past their campsite, the organizer and his girlfriend disappeared—the spot that they had occupied was blank.
In the early hours of the morning, a car had plummeted through a tent; one of its wheels rolled over the head of a man, who was sleeping, and a woman was seriously scalded— a boiling froth of water mixed with antifreeze had spewed all over her. It was an absolute horror—in one way, even worse than the fatality: the people that this happened to were absolutely innocent. I remembered that in planning the event, it had occurred to me that we might somehow segregate the cars in parking lots at compass points around our central circle. But our organization, such as it was, could never have accomplished this; we had neither the resources nor the organizational infrastructure. Without roads, a gate, or any proper boundaries, my notion seemed entirely bootless, and I hadn’t even bothered to propose it—but now I had to face the moral consequence of our inaction. I vowed that we would find a way to stop such things from ever happening again.
We conducted a debriefing with Pershing County law enforcement officers at the close of the event. I hadn’t been informed of this meeting, but showed up anyway, having learned about it only minutes beforehand. When I entered the tent, I spotted three or four Black Rock Rangers sitting to one side. They looked distraught—clearly, they’d been shaken up by their experience. During our discussion, one announced that Burning Man was uncontrollable. Another stood and said that it should never be allowed to occur again. In retrospect, this now reminds me of how the kids, in the rural neighborhood where I grew up, conducted dirt clod fights. Rival groups would line up on either side of a field, heaving chunks of untilled earth at one another. This would continue until someone took a dirt clod in the head. Everyone would then run home, and no one seemed inclined to take responsibility.

And yet, I also noticed that the deputies, gathered at one end of the tent, remained remarkably calm. They had witnessed deaths in the desert before, and they had conducted emergency evacuations—they were professionals. As people filed out, I stopped to talk with the Sheriff. I said that in the future we’d create an ordered world. I told him, “We will build a real city next year.” Suddenly, a Ranger interposed himself between us, saying, “There should never have been more than 70 people here.” —then skittered away. Sheriff Skinner fixed his eyes on me and shook my hand. Not without some irony, he wished me luck.
Back in San Francisco, in the immediate aftermath of the event, four or five people elected to leave the group, but in the following year our staff doubled, and now featured at least four tiers of organization —we moved on. As a result of the reforms we put into place in 1997, our city grew more civilized. Instead of driving cars, as was the fashion, at 100 miles-per-hour with the lights turned off, people began to encounter one another. Once we eliminated firearms, invented the Greeters, repurposed and reorganized the Rangers, created a street grid, regulated traffic, increased population densities, and gave everyone an address, people could more freely interact; theme camps tripled, villages thrived, entire neighborhoods began to come alive.
Perhaps, that is the final irony. We ended up creating a world defined by free association and communal aid—rather like that dream of social harmony envisioned by the original anarchists. This was the beginning of the modern phase of Burning Man. We actually published ten rules that year [as distinct from the Ten Principles, first published in 2004], very simple ones, in our newsletter. The nascent institutions we’d invented, sometimes half in jest, became realities. Our city, many of us felt, had acquired a soul.
Postscript: for eons, in almost every civilization, the bards have sung of legends, and this is true for Burning Man as well. A tip of the hat to Mark Silverman for this gem:

About the author: Larry Harvey
Born in 1948, Larry Harvey grew up on a small farm on the outskirts of Portland, Oregon. In the late 1970s he moved to San Francisco, and soon discovered the city's thriving underground art scene. In 1986 he founded Burning Man at a local beach, and guided its progress from that moment until his death in 2018. Larry was Founding Board Member and Chief Philosophic Officer of Burning Man Project. He scripted and co-curated Burning Man's annual art theme and collaborated with artists in creating aspects of the art theme and the design of Black Rock City. Larry also wrote articles and essays for the Project's website. As spokesperson for Burning Man, he was frequently interviewed by reporters, and lectured on subjects as diverse as art, religion, civic planning and the rise of cyber-culture in the era of the Internet. Larry was also a political planner, supervising the organization's lobbying efforts and frequently attending meetings with state, county and federal agencies.

Larry,
Thank you for telling this story. My wife and I were there in ’96 and we weren’t sure we would ever come back. It was an amazing experience, but there was a feeling that it was out of control and that people could get hurt. I can still remember the night of the burn when people were running trough an art installation while it burned around them. I was sick from the worry that the burning building would fall on one of them.
We came back in ’98 and all of that was gone. The craziness was now focused on creativity and self expression. We have been coming out to the playa ever since and having been there from the early years, we are proud the way our community has grown.
Thank you Larry for all you have been for us.
Michael Shaun

I too remember the days of ‘dirt-clod’ combat on the edges of those pre-sprawl suburban neighborhoods in early 1960’s America. I truly applaud your courage in not running back home to hide after the first clod accidentally ‘hit-it’s-mark’.
That is ultimately what the best of us are all about. Taking responsibility for starting the fire sometimes means both ‘feeling the heat’ but getting occasionally ‘getting burned’.

96 was my first year. I was in awe of Hellco. I remember thinking how on earth were people able to bring such creativity all the way out to the desert…
I also remember the rave camp. We rode our bikes from camp to the one green pyramid where a single dj was spinning….

“A similar proposal aimed at eliminating the nominally uncool involved locating Burning Man much further north and setting up sentries—with radios and guns. “We won’t tell anyone where we are”, it was said, “and we’ll see them coming.” I don’t know what they thought they would do once they saw them coming. Shoot their tires? The very notion was puerile. ”
I find it amazing how this attitude keeps appearing in different guises.A few years ago during Chicken John/Jim Mason’s “Borg 2” experiment, there was a faction that wanted to do exactly the same kind of thing within the BRC limits – I recall one enthusiast wanting to “patrol the borders” of the Borg 2 enclave – again, with no conception of what they would possibly do to stop someone from entering who she thought wouldn’t belong. That’s about when I stopped participating in discussions for that little effort.

I would just like to add….
…… in 1990 Larry and friend showed a small home made video at the Anon Salon’s summer party ..it was a month following their nascent desert event.
Marica , Joegh and Mark, featured Larry and his small movie in one of their Salon exhibit rooms where Anon goers could view the Fellini style desert happening.
That evening many of us learned about the event, and where we could sign up for future info via the 1991 happening. We all wanted to go and participate.
Although the Cacophony Society had a ssmall following , it was the Anon Following that exponentially grew BurningMan IMHO.
If Larry will recall, the Anon Salon established itself back in 1980-82 and pioneered much of SOMA and put on many huge pay parties .. i.e Party Science in the old MGB Building , etc… fashion shows , live music art, and dance. They produced huge events in the 1980’s with a huge hip following of artists, photographers, models, ad people , etc. all over south of market. They pioneered SOMA.
I wish Larry et al, would give more credit IN WRITING to the pioneers of the Salon Anon airing that 1990 video , because, as a witness to it all, I saw the Anon Salon Tribe build BurningMan in a huge way the following 5 years with their hard earned followers via the 80’s.
The Anon Salon visionaries were great orgainizers of big events and their business savvy did indeed grow BM with the help of Larry’s inner circle the event from 1991-2000. The rest is art history.
Why is this important piece of history left out the Larry Blog equation ?
The Anon Salon pioneers were the ones that catapolted the growth and i saw the whole thing from the inside out and feel this bit of BurningMan history is crucial to it’s success today. and art movement it has become !
Hey Larry, marcia, joegh and mark are due a huge bonus this Holiday

This comment is a reply to Famous Mellisa:
I do indeed remember the Anon Salons and all of the people who made them possible. I didn’t include this in my post because it wasn’t germane to the particular story I was telling. On the other hand, I did retrieve the memory of the Latte Carpenters, a group whose contribution has since lapsed into oblivion, because this part of our history is crucial to explaining the political struggles that occurred in the early Nineties. But you should rest assured; it is the mission of the Philosophical Center to examine and illuminate all of our history. Eventually, the story of the Anon Salon, along with the equally significant soirees at the home Miss P, will also be told.

Thank you for sharing this story Larry. I am a fairly new devotee of the Burning Man but I’ve nonetheless heard countless “veterans” bemoan how many rules and regulations are in effect nowadays and how it was better in the old days. Your post very concisely explains why we need to have rules in order for creativity to foster without fear of accidental mortal consequence due to overly reckless individuals. I appreciate your candidness in accepting what has happened and wanting to try to prevent any further tragedies even though they weren’t your fault (despite what some may say). The next time I hear or read someone whining about how many rules Burning Man has in place, I’m going to link them to this post so they can understand why they are in place.

I keep hearing people complain about Burning Man’s growing, out-of-control frat boy problem. I imagine them scattered across the playa, piling up in dunes at the trash fence like so much moop. I hope to someday spot them there, passed out among the feathers and glitter with beer can s on their dehydrated little foreheads.

It’s so cool to hear this from your perspective, Larry. I came into the Burn when it was on the beach, via M2. I saw M2 every day at work, and would participate in the odd Cacophony event or Anon Salon here and there, so when I went to the Burn on the beach, and then the first two years in the desert, I felt very much an outsider. All these people seemed to know each other through other circles, and I was in one of the outer rings, orbiting through the center of the system from time to time.
So the perspective I got from the “outside” was mostly a puzzling array of people being free spirits and doing weird things.
Reading how all these threads connected together for you was enlightening! Thanks for writing this up. 25 years, and still learning!

Ive enjoyed reading this page. It substantiates much of what ive suspected about “what Is really going on” out at that party. I wish to make it someday, and Ive often imagined a place where I can cease to know ‘who is cool’ where I am. Even though Id risk running into them at Burning Man I’d be someone differant because I was there.
