THE THEME
October 18, 2017 By Larry Harvey & Stuart Mangrum 140 
1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
— Isaac Asimov, I, Robot
Becoming Human by Christian Ristow, Black Rock City 2015 (Photo by Playaman)
I, Robot, first published in 1950, is a collection of short science fiction stories by author Isaac Asimov. It is perhaps most famous for the three essential laws embedded deep in every robot’s positronic brain.
At first glance, these ethical precepts seem simple enough; they are really not much different from the Golden Rule. But a team of robot psychologists, engaged in what we would today call quality control, soon discover certain glitches that become quite sinister.
Asimov, like philosophers before him, naturally assumed that there could be no true morality without emotion. This battle between the qualitative and the quantitative, between human consciousness and abstract calculation, isn’t easily resolved, but one thing does seem certain: nobody likes an angry robot.
This year’s art theme will focus on the many forms of artificial intelligence that permeate our lives; from the humble algorithm and its subroutines that sift us, sort us and surveil us, to automated forms of labor that supplant us. Are we entering a Golden Age that frees us all from mindless labor? Everything, it seems, depends on HMI, the Human-Machine Interface. In a world increasingly controlled by smart machines, who will be master and who will be the slave?
“People degrade themselves in order to make machines seem smart all the time. Before the crash, bankers believed in supposedly intelligent algorithms that could calculate credit risks before making bad loans. We ask teachers to teach to standardized tests so a student will look good to an algorithm. We have repeatedly demonstrated our species’ bottomless ability to lower our standards to make information technology look good.”
― Jaron Lanier, You Are Not a Gadget
It is no wonder that AI is starting to look all-powerful and inevitable. So-called creative content is increasingly hackwork; indistinguishable from the output of algorithms programmed to imitate prose, poetry, and pop songs. It’s not so much that robots are getting closer to human as that we are lowering our standards of comparison. Such compromises make us dumber and lazier — putting our trust in algorithms without questioning their assumptions.
And yet, if we turn the telescope around and regard the capacity of robots to process information and draw conclusions from almost unlimited databases, it becomes possible to imagine a solipsistic world in which most of our friends or even all of our friends will be robots: we would be surrounded by a slave labor force. Having out-sourced our minds, we might choose to out-source our selves. Who doesn’t want a friend who mirrors one’s own opinion of one’s self? Already it appears we may be moving in this direction. Consumerism makes us crave convenience and seek instant gratification, pointing toward an automated future shorn of human contact.
I.T. by Michael Christian, Black Rock City 2006 (Photo by Brian Herman)
“More human than human is our motto.”
― Dr. Tyrell, Blade Runner
The allure of immortality and god-like powers is as old as god. The Greeks, who more or less invented humanism, had a word for this ― they called it hubris, making it the basis of all tragedy. This enduring fantasy is lately clothed in cyber-togs. It is said that computational power is increasing exponentially, much like the singularity that created the universe, and charts and numbers are employed to predict the point in time at which this supra-intelligence will take over.
This is a millenarian idea, sometimes called the Rapture of the Techies, and like all such schemes, it is essentially a religious concept now dressed in the trappings of science. In this scenario, the future rule of one vast integrated Robot will exceed all human comprehension. This notion also contains an ingenious escape clause, a sort of intellectual insurance policy. When pressed to pinpoint exactly when this event will occur, its acolytes reply that it may have already happened — its advent will elude the grasp of slimy brains. This is a contest between wet intelligence, something that we barely understand that has evolved on earth over a span of billions of years, and dry intelligence, which in its digital form was invented in 1936.
“Smart machines may make higher GDP possible, but they will also reduce the demand for people — including smart people. So we could be looking at a society that grows ever richer, but in which all the gains in wealth accrue to whoever owns the robots.”
Burning Man has been pioneering the post-work world for decades. What would you do if you could do what you wanted? And not what you had to do to make a living? Reawakening those desires is a transformative experience; relearning how to dream, how to play, how to have desires that arise innately from your being, rather than selected off a shelf of preprogrammed experiences — and perhaps most importantly, to do all this in a community that brings you into living contact with your fellow human beings.
Wizard of Oz: “As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart. You don’t know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable.”
Tin Woodsman: “But I still want one.”
This year we invite participants to use their native genius to create expressive robots of all kinds. We also welcome art that examines how it feels to live in a world that is filled with robots that watch us, track us, hack us, read our tweets and s, listen to our phone calls, and sell this information to other robots. This is a science fiction theme. As always, any work of art by anyone, regardless of our theme, is welcome at the Burning Man event. If you are planning to do fire art on the open playa, please see our Playa Art Guidelines for more information. To apply for a grant to fund the creation of artwork for Burning Man 2018, see our Black Rock City Honoraria page.

Named after a recent movie? Try again. You might as well say it was named after the book by Isaac Asimov that was first published in 1950. Or the short story published in 1939 by Earl and Otto Binder.
OMG, Burning Man uses a theme title that’s been in the popular culture for 75 years. Shocking!
Who’s this “Will Smith” anyway? Does he go to Burning Man?

Sadly Asimov took much of his story from Karel Capek’s RUR (Rossum’s Universal Robots)… Even the recent release of Blade Runner bases a huge part of the story (robots that can procreate) from the book.

Sorry Grumpy, it is actually named after; Isaac Asimov, I, Robot. A Sci-Fi classic piece of literature that is even more important today than ever. It is where the three rules that all robots should abide by comes from. Yet in the end, they do not seem to fulfill their purpose.
1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

grumpy burner’s comment is really not that remarkable. Studies that measure eye movements indicate that attention on the Internet typically takes the form of a capital “F”. People read the first two lines of a text, then drop down and partially consume another line. After that, they get on board an express elevator, plummeting downwards while briefly grabbing at individual words – needless to say; they seldom arrive in the lobby. In other words, we do not read for comprehension; instead we’ve learned to scan. This does not lead to consecutive thought, but it is uncannily like what algorithms do. In a way, grumpy burner simply compressed this process; he read the title and skipped the text altogether.

Very cool theme! But don’t forget about the Zeroth Law, which Asimov added in a later story (from Wiki):
The 0th Law
In the chapter “The Duel” in Robots and Empire, Asimov first presents another law, which he calls the Zeroth Law of Robotics, and adjusts the other ones accordingly:
0. A robot may not harm humanity, or through inaction allow humanity to come to harm.
1. A robot may not harm a human, or through inaction allow a human to come to harm, unless this interferes with the zeroth law.
2. A robot must obey orders given to it by a human being unless such orders interfere with the zeroth or first laws.
3. A robot must defend its own existence unless such defense interferes with the zeroth, first or second laws.

I have to say this is a disappointing theme. Burning Man used to be a place where you could escape the main political-economic themes of the default world but I guess no longer. This year’s theme is just too close to home. I personally do not want to explore what being a robot means at Burning Man. Sorry but spending a week mired in thinking and acting about technology, gadgets, the surveillance state, and robots isn’t radical. Its called every day life in the US these days.I think we get enough of that in the default world.
Larry I think its time to give up the theme-writing to someone else…
A more cynical side of me would point-out that just as Burning Man seems to have “pivoted” towards tech money (eg PnP camps, billionaire board members, $1,000 donation tickets etc.) the themes have magically pivoted to tech and money as well. Wasn’t last year’s theme basically “Love Your Rich Benefactor” ? And this year’s “Think MORE about technology” Jesus Christ. I predict 2018 theme will involve the word “Innovation”
When’s the IPO?

Is it the responsibility of an event such as BM to provide a place for people to “escape” the themes and memes of daily life? Or should it be perhaps something more?
Robots, and the underlying and related technologies they iconographically represent, are becoming a part of our world faster than most of us could have predicted, and faster than most of us are happy about. And it’s all happening without much discussion or input from the general populace. No one is asking how we feel about it, there are no votes about whether self-driving trucks are a good idea (thanks, capitalism!).
I haven’t found the part of the theme announcement which states that only sympathetic portrayals of robots/tech will be acceptable on the playa. I think you’re right when you say that the theme is asking us to think MORE about technology. Somebody needs to.
Why not trust this community to do it? Or at least offer the chance? I think this theme means that BM might actually contribute something to this thus-far very one-sided, and very timely, conversation.

My favorite sculpture last year was the robot! (Mechan 9) This might be cool, and all you dissers should read some Asimov before rejecting this. What an amazing & prolific writer. The Foundation series was my favorite book in high school in the early 1970s.
Interesting that it’s introduced now: usually BM Org waits for a while, like November or December before laying out the next year’s theme…

In the olden days, the theme was announced with the ticket sales, then for a few years (around Green Man), it was announced on burn night after the Man fell. So this is still a bit late, besides it takes time to build a Robot that will kill us all…

“Who doesn’t want a friend who mirrors one’s own opinion of one’s self?” This sentence above struck me immediately.
Google and Facebook are doing just this for profit, meanwhile they are atomizing people and splintering societies across the planet into their own little echo chambers. I do my best to avoid both of these corporations in my cyber endeavors, but it is difficult to be 100% free of them. I notice my tracker blocker is blocking Google Analytics on this site right now.
Steve Jobs talked al lot about amplifying human intelligence with computers, unfortunately, with all of his intelligence, it seems he did not realize computers would amplify lots of other human tendencies like stupidity, hatred, and yes, even ignorance. I have a close friend who is a total conspiracy nut, chemtrails, aliens, and more. I do take heart that he consulted me for observational proofs he was having with the “flat earthers” in his Faceboook activities. He is not totally off the deep end.
I think this will be an awesome theme! Can’t remember being this excited about next year’s theme in years, and can’t wait to see how this manifests at this coming Burn.

It’s nice to see that someone notices that this year’s theme is somewhat dystopian. I am not a Luddite, and agree with Steve Jobs when he said AI can amplify human intelligence, but computers are not conscious. They can process data faster than the human brain, and they can analyze and correlate this information almost instantaneously. This impresses us greatly, but it only simulates thought. Human beings have a tendency to mistake any new tool for a task, turning a means into meaning itself. I am only suggesting that when dealing with our robot friends we should pause, think and stop devaluing ourselves.

I believe the theme this year is really awesome! It’s about time we look at our technological society, and see how the robots are hurting/helping us.
I mean, we have Billboards that line our Freeways, flashing neon/led lights and images of alcohol advertisements into our subconscious, but no accountability to the companies in charge when people go out drunk driving (I live in AZ, a zero tolerance state, where a crash involving an injury or death – will send you straight to prison for 5+ years).
Corporations spend billions of dollars a year into reing how to manipulate and influence the human mind into wanting and craving certain things, and then deliver their goals through technological means (digital marketing), with absolutely no repercussions for alcoholism, and drunk driving accidents.
Self driving robot cars, paid for by huge alcohol companies, should be driving people home safely from the bar – and stopping at Del Taco for you and your bros who have zero respect for your sphincter!
I saw Steve Jobs mentioned earlier, and he was a royal ass clown, and horrible human being – piece of dog shit you step on while barefoot on your lawn during summer (not your dog btw) for how he treated other humans. So anything with “iPhone, or iRobot” makes me vomit in my mouth. That’s the only problem I have with the title.
The irony is the fact that I am writing this comment on a Macbook Air, which is charging my iPhone – maybe I’m the royal ass clown?

1. A Burner may not injure a human being or, through inaction, or just being really fucked up, allow a human being to come to harm. Unless they are really douchey, then it’s ok.
2. A Burner must obey orders given by a guy in a feathered headdress except where such orders would conflict with the First Law or are like, really hard.
3. A Burner must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law or require them to pick up after themselves.

At first hearing this theme I did the facepalm along with a ‘good grief, not again’ response. Then as i thought about the theme, an art project popped into my head within the first day. I never have done an art project before and for this theme to elicit such ideas means it must be thought provoking. Thus maybe it is a good one. Much better than a vague Radical RItual Beyond Belief. I just hope i can take this vision to reality.
